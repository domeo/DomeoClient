The higher the score is the better the annotation is. The scoring algorithm gives a specific weight to an annotation according to the context of this annotation. For instance, an annotation done by matching a concept preferred name will be given a higher weight than an annotation done by matching a concept synonym or than an annotation done with a parent level 3 in the is_a hierarchy.
	public boolean withSynonyms = true; // Specifies whether or not the direct annotations are generated based on term synonyms. By default it includes all the synonyms and preferred name of a term. If 'false' is selected, the direct annotations are done with only the preferred name.
