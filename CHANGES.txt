Build 40
=====================================
 40.0  Enhancement
 	Added build number in the start of the logging.
 
 40.1  Enhancement
	Activated 'Retrieve Sets' in the 'Sets' right side panel. The resulting
 	panel shows only the existing sets that can be loaded and will not list 
 	those sets that are already loaded in the Annotator. 
    
 40.2  Polishing
 	Commented out button 'Explore' for Annotation Set Tab as it is not yet
 	functional.   
       
 40.3  Bug fix
	Fixed the left border of the 'Discussion panel' and the resizing of the 
 	main panel so that it now takes the whole available space.
 	
 40.4  Bug fix
    Deletion of comments now executes and updates the counter in the card
    (popup) and refreshes the discussion side panel accordingly.
    
 40.5  Enhancement
    Yale Image finder Integration (partial)
    
 40.6  Enhancement
   Improvements for using the Qualifier Search Panel also for qualifiers 
   targeting the full document (partial).
