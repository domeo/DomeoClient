Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Ontak. Ontak should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        It is not known whether Ontak is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Ontak, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Ontak, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.4 Pediatric Use<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.5 Geriatric Use<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        Clinical studies of Ontak did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
