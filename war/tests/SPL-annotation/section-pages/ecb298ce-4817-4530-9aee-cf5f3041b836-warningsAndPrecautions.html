For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for DETROL LA is 2 mg once daily.

The dose of DETROL LA should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10–30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of DETROL LA in this population is not recommended [see <BR>                              DOSAGE AND  ADMINISTRATION (2.2)<BR>                           <BR>                            and <BR>                           <BR>                              USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.7 Myasthenia Gravis<BR>                     <BR>                        Administer DETROL LA with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.8  Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation<BR>                     <BR>                        In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see<BR>                                  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2)<BR>                              <BR>                           ], the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped.  <BR>                        These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe DETROL LA to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications.
