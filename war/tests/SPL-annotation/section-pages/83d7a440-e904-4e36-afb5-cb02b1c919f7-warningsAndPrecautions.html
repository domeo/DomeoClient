Exposure was increased in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, therefore a dose of 250 mg is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].<BR>                        <BR>                        FASLODEX has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.3 Use in Pregnancy<BR>                     <BR>                        Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, FASLODEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Fulvestrant caused fetal loss or abnormalities in animals when administered during the period of organogenesis at doses significantly smaller than the maximum recommended human dose based on the body surface area. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using FASLODEX. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant while receiving FASLODEX. If FASLODEX is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
