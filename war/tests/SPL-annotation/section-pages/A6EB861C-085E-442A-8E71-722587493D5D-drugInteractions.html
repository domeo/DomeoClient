Retrospective analysis of side effects in clinical trials showed that poor 2D6 metabolizers had a higher rate of dizziness during up-titration, presumably resulting from vasodilating effects of the higher concentrations of the α-blocking R(+) enantiomer. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Retrospective analysis of side effects in clinical trials showed that poor 2D6 metabolizers had a higher rate of dizziness during up-titration, presumably resulting from vasodilating effects of the higher concentrations of the α-blocking R(+) enantiomer.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>7.2  Hypotensive Agents<BR>Patients taking both agents with β-blocking properties and a drug that can deplete catecholamines (e.g., reserpine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) should be observed closely for signs of hypotension and/or severe bradycardia.Concomitant administration of clonidine with agents with β-blocking properties may potentiate blood-pressure- and heart-rate-lowering effects. When concomitant treatment with agents with β-blocking properties and clonidine is to be terminated, the β-blocking agent should be discontinued first. Clonidine therapy can then be discontinued several days later by gradually decreasing the dosage.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>7.3  Cyclosporine<BR>Modest increases in mean trough cyclosporine concentrations were observed following initiation of carvedilol treatment in 21 renal transplant patients suffering from chronic vascular rejection. In about 30% of patients, the dose of cyclosporine had to be reduced in order to maintain cyclosporine concentrations within the therapeutic range, while in the remainder no adjustment was needed. On the average for the group, the dose of cyclosporine was reduced about 20% in these patients. Due to wide interindividual variability in the dose adjustment required, it is recommended that cyclosporine concentrations be monitored closely after initiation of carvedilol therapy and that the dose of cyclosporine be adjusted as appropriate.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>7.4  Digitalis Glycosides<BR>Both digitalis glycosides and β-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Digoxin concentrations are increased by about 15% when digoxin and carvedilol are administered concomitantly. Therefore, increased monitoring of digoxin is recommended when initiating, adjusting, or discontinuing carvedilol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>7.5  Inducers/Inhibitors of Hepatic Metabolism<BR>Rifampin reduced plasma concentrations of carvedilol by about 70% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. Cimetidine increased AUC by about 30% but caused no change in Cmax [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. Cimetidine increased AUC by about 30% but caused no change in C<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>7.6  Calcium Channel Blockers<BR>Conduction disturbance (rarely with hemodynamic compromise) has been observed when carvedilol is co-administered with diltiazem. As with other agents with β-blocking properties, if carvedilol is to be administered with calcium channel blockers of the verapamil or diltiazem type, it is recommended that ECG and blood pressure be monitored.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>7.7  Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics<BR>Agents with β-blocking properties may enhance the blood sugar reducing effect of insulin and oral hypoglycemics. Therefore, in patients taking insulin or oral hypoglycemics, regular monitoring of blood glucose is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
