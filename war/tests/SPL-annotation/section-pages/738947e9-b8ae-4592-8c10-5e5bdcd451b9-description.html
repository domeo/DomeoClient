The average molecular weight of the PEG portion of the molecule is 12,000 daltons. The average molecular weight of the SYLATRON molecule is approximately 31,000 daltons. The specific activity of pegylated interferon alfa-2b is approximately 0.7 Ã— 108 international units/mg protein.<BR>                  Interferon alfa-2b is a protein with a molecular weight of 19,271 daltons produced by recombinant DNA techniques. It is obtained from the bacterial fermentation of a strain of Escherichia coli bearing a genetically engineered plasmid containing an interferon gene from human leukocytes.<BR>                  Each vial contains either 296 mcg, 444 mcg or 888 mcg of peginterferon alfa-2b as a sterile, white to off-white lyophilized powder, and dibasic sodium phosphate anhydrous (1.11 mg), monobasic sodium phosphate dihydrate (1.11 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.074 mg), and sucrose (59.2 mg). Following reconstitution with 0.7 mL of Sterile Water for Injection USP, each vial contains SYLATRON at 40 mcg per 0.1 mL, 60 mcg per 0.1 mL, or 120 mcg per 0.1 mL.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
