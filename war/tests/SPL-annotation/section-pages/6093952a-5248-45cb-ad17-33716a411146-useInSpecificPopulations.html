There are no adequate and well controlled studies with Tasigna in pregnant women. Women should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on Tasigna. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.<BR>                        Nilotinib was studied for effects on embryo-fetal development in pregnant rats and rabbits given oral doses of 10, 30, 100 mg/kg/day, and 30, 100, 300 mg/kg/day, respectively, during organogenesis. In rats, nilotinib at doses of 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 5.7 times the AUC in patients at the dose of 400 mg twice daily) was associated with maternal toxicity (decreased gestation weight, gravid uterine weight, net weight gain, and food consumption). Nilotinib at doses ≥30 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the AUC in patients at the dose of 400 mg twice daily) resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity as shown by increased resorption and post-implantation loss, and at 100 mg/kg/day, a decrease in viable fetuses. In rabbits, maternal toxicity at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately one-half the human exposure based on AUC) was associated with mortality, abortion, decreased gestation weights and decreased food consumption. Embryonic toxicity (increased resorption) and minor skeletal anomalies were observed at a dose of 300 mg/kg/day. Nilotinib is not considered teratogenic.<BR>                        When pregnant rats were dosed with nilotinib during organogenesis and through lactation, the adverse effects included a longer gestational period, lower pup body weights until weaning and decreased fertility indices in the pups when they reached maturity, all at a maternal dose of 360 mg/m2 (approximately 0.7 times the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily based on body surface area). At doses up to 120 mg/m2 (approximately 0.25 times the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily based on body surface area) no adverse effects were seen in the maternal animals or the pups.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3     Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        It is not known whether nilotinib is excreted in human milk. One study in lactating rats demonstrates that nilotinib is excreted into milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Tasigna, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4     Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        The safety and effectiveness of Tasigna in pediatric patients have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5     Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        In the clinical trials of Tasigna (patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP and resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP), approximately 12% and 30% of patients were 65 years or over respectively.<BR>                        <BR>                           Patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP: There was no difference in major molecular response between patients aged <65 years and those ≥65 years.<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Patients with resistant or intolerant CML-CP: There was no difference in major cytogenetic response rate between patients aged <65 years and those ≥65 years.<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Patients with resistant or intolerant CML-AP: The hematologic response rate was 44% in patients <65 years of age and 29% in patients ≥65 years.<BR>                        <BR>                        No major differences for safety were observed in patients ≥65 years of age as compared to patients <65 years.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.6     Cardiac Disorders<BR>                     <BR>                        In the clinical trials, patients with a history of uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia, were excluded.

In a study of subjects with mild to severe hepatic impairment following a single dose administration of 200 mg of Tasigna, the mean AUC values were increased on average of 35%, 35% and 56% in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A, score 5-6), moderate (Child-Pugh class B, score 7-9) and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C, score 10-15), respectively, compared to a control group of subjects with normal hepatic function. Table 8 summarizes the Child-Pugh Liver Function Classification applied in this study. A lower starting dose is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment and the QT interval should be monitored closely in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><BR>                           <caption>Table 8: Child-Pugh Liver Function Classification</caption><BR>                           <col width="295"/><BR>                           <col width="192"/><BR>                           <col width="103"/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule "><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Assessment </content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Degree of </content><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">A</content><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">bnormality</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Score</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule ">Encephalopathy Grade</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">None</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">1</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule ">&#160;</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule " align="center">1 or 2</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule " align="center">2</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule ">&#160;</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule " align="center">3 or 4</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule " align="center">3</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule ">Ascites</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">Absent</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">1</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule ">&#160;</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule " align="center">Slight</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule " align="center">2</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule ">&#160;</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule " align="center">Moderate</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule " align="center">3</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule ">Total Bilirubin (mg/dL)</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">&lt;2</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">1</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule ">&#160;</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule " align="center">2 -
