However, due to the <BR>close pharmacological similarities among the tricyclics, the reactions should be <BR>considered when prescribing doxepin.<BR>                  <BR>                     Anticholinergic Effects: Dry mouth, blurred vision, <BR>constipation and urinary retention have been reported. If they do not subside <BR>with continued therapy or become severe, it may be necessary to reduce the <BR>dosage.<BR>                  <BR>                     Central Nervous System Effects: Drowsiness is the <BR>most commonly noticed side effect. This tends to disappear as therapy is <BR>continued. Other infrequently reported CNS side effects are confusion, <BR>disorientation, hallucinations, numbness, paresthesias, ataxia, extrapyramidal <BR>symptoms, seizures, tardive dyskinesia, and tremor.<BR>                  <BR>                     Cardiovascular: Cardiovascular effects including <BR>hypotension, hypertension, and tachycardia have been reported occasionally.<BR>                  <BR>                     Allergic: Skin rash, edema, photosensitization, and <BR>pruritus have occasionally occurred.<BR>                  <BR>                     Hematologic: Eosinophilia has been reported in a few <BR>patients. There have been occasional reports of bone marrow depression <BR>manifesting as agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and purpura.<BR>                  <BR>                     Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, indigestion, <BR>taste disturbances, diarrhea, anorexia, and aphthous stomatitis have been <BR>reported. (See  Anticholinergic Effects.)<BR>                  <BR>                     Endocrine: Raised or lowered libido, testicular <BR>swelling, gynecomastia in males, enlargement of breasts and galactorrhea in the <BR>female, raising or lowering of blood sugar levels and syndrome of inappropriate <BR>antidiuretic hormone secretion have been reported with tricyclic <BR>administration.<BR>                  <BR>                     Other: Dizziness, tinnitus, weight gain, sweating, <BR>chills, fatigue, weakness, flushing, jaundice, alopecia, headache, exacerbation <BR>of asthma, and hyperpyrexia (in association with chlorpromazine) have been <BR>occasionally observed as adverse effects.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Withdrawal Symptoms<BR>                  The possibility of development of withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt <BR>cessation of treatment after prolonged doxepin administration should be borne in <BR>mind. These are not indicative of addiction and gradual withdrawal of medication <BR>should not cause these symptoms.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
