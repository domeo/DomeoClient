The dose of letrozole tablets in patients with cirrhosis and severe hepatic dysfunction should be reduced by 50% [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The recommended dose of letrozole tablets for such patients is 2.5 mg administered every other day. The effect of hepatic impairment on letrozole tablets exposure in noncirrhotic cancer patients with elevated bilirubin levels has not been determined.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.6 Use in Renal Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment if creatinine clearance is ≥10 mL/min.
