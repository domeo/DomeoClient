Effient is formulated as the hydrochloride salt, a racemate, which is chemically designated as 5-[(1RS)-2-cyclopropyl-1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-2-yl acetate hydrochloride. Prasugrel hydrochloride has the empirical formula C20H20FNO3S•HCl representing a molecular weight of 409.90. The chemical structure of prasugrel hydrochloride is:<BR>                  <BR>                  Prasugrel hydrochloride is a white to practically white solid. It is soluble at pH 2, slightly soluble at pH 3 to 4, and practically insoluble at pH 6 to 7.5. It also dissolves freely in methanol and is slightly soluble in 1- and 2-propanol and acetone. It is practically insoluble in diethyl ether and ethyl acetate.<BR>                  Effient is available for oral administration as 5 mg or 10 mg elongated hexagonal, film-coated, non-scored tablets, debossed on each side. Each yellow 5 mg tablet is manufactured with 5.49 mg prasugrel hydrochloride, equivalent to 5 mg prasugrel and each beige 10 mg tablet with 10.98 mg prasugrel hydrochloride, equivalent to 10 mg of prasugrel. During manufacture and storage, partial conversion from prasugrel hydrochloride to prasugrel free base may occur. Other ingredients include mannitol, hypromellose, croscarmellose sodium, microcrystalline cellulose, and vegetable magnesium stearate. The color coatings contain lactose, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, triacetin, iron oxide yellow, and iron oxide red (only in Effient 10 mg tablet).<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>						Chemical Structure<BR>					<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
