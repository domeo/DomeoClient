Studies in <BR>animals also suggest that fluoxetine is a much more potent uptake inhibitor of <BR>serotonin than of norepinephrine. <BR>                        Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic and α1-adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated <BR>with various anticholinergic, sedative and cardiovascular effects of classical <BR>tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drugs. Fluoxetine binds to these and other <BR>membrane receptors from brain tissue much less potently in <BR>vitro than do the tricyclic drugs. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        Systemic BioavailabilityIn man, following a single oral 40 mg dose, peak plasma <BR>concentrations of fluoxetine from 15 to 55 ng/mL are observed after 6 to 8 <BR>hours. <BR>                        The capsule, oral solution and weekly capsule dosage forms of fluoxetine are <BR>bioequivalent. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of <BR>fluoxetine, although it may delay its absorption by 1 to 2 hours, which is <BR>probably not clinically significant. Thus, fluoxetine may be administered with <BR>or without food.<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Protein BindingOver the concentration range from 200 to 1000 ng/mL, <BR>approximately 94.5% of fluoxetine is bound in vitro <BR>to human serum proteins, including albumin and α1-glycoprotein. The interaction between fluoxetine and other <BR>highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated, but may be important. <BR><BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        EnantiomersFluoxetine is a racemic mixture (50/50) of R-fluoxetine and S-fluoxetine <BR>enantiomers. In animal models, both enantiomers are specific and potent <BR>serotonin uptake inhibitors with essentially equivalent pharmacologic activity. <BR>The S-fluoxetine enantiomer is eliminated more slowly <BR>and is the predominant enantiomer present in plasma at steady-state. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        MetabolismFluoxetine is extensively metabolized in the liver to <BR>norfluoxetine and a number of other unidentified metabolites. The only <BR>identified active metabolite, norfluoxetine, is formed by demethylation of <BR>fluoxetine. In animal models, S-norfluoxetine is a <BR>potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin uptake and has activity essentially <BR>equivalent to R- or S-fluoxetine. R-norfluoxetine is <BR>significantly less potent than the parent drug in the inhibition of serotonin <BR>uptake. The primary route of elimination appears to be hepatic metabolism to <BR>inactive metabolites excreted by the kidney. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Variability in MetabolismA subset (about 7%) of the population has reduced activity of the <BR>drug metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Such individuals are <BR>referred to as “poor metabolizers” of drugs such as debrisoquin, <BR>dextromethorphan and the TCAs. In a study involving labeled and unlabeled <BR>enantiomers administered as a racemate, these individuals metabolized S-fluoxetine at a slower rate and thus achieved higher <BR>concentrations of S-fluoxetine. Consequently, <BR>concentrations of S-norfluoxetine at steady state <BR>were lower. The metabolism of R-fluoxetine in these <BR>poor metabolizers appears normal. When compared with normal metabolizers, the <BR>total sum at steady-state of the plasma concentrations of the four active <BR>enantiomers was not significantly greater among poor metabolizers. Thus, the net <BR>pharmacodynamic activities were essentially the same. Alternative, nonsaturable <BR>pathways (non-2D6) also contribute to the metabolism of fluoxetine. This <BR>explains how fluoxetine achieves a steady-state concentration rather than <BR>increasing without limit. <BR>                        Because fluoxetine’s metabolism, like that of a number of other compounds <BR>including TCAs and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), <BR>involves the CYP2D6 system, concomitant therapy with drugs also metabolized by <BR>this enzyme system (such as the TCAs) may lead to drug interactions [see <BR>                                 Drug Interactions <BR>(7.9)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Accumulation and Slow EliminationThe relatively slow elimination of fluoxetine (elimination <BR>half-life of 1 to 3 days after acute administration and 4 to 6 days after <BR>chronic administration) and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine (elimination <BR>half-life of 4 to 16 days after acute and chronic administration), leads to <BR>significant accumulation of these active species in chronic use and delayed <BR>attainment of steady-state, even when a fixed dose is used [see <BR>                                 Warnings and <BR>Precautions (5.12)<BR>                              ]. After 30 days of dosing at 40 mg/day, <BR>plasma concentrations of fluoxetine in the range of 91 to 302 ng/mL and <BR>norfluoxetine in the range of 72 to 258 ng/mL have been observed. Plasma <BR>concentrations of fluoxetine were higher than those predicted by single-dose <BR>studies, because fluoxetine’s metabolism is not proportional to dose. <BR>Norfluoxetine, however, appears to have linear pharmacokinetics. Its mean <BR>terminal half-life after a single dose was 8.6 days and after multiple dosing <BR>was 9.3 days. Steady-state levels after prolonged dosing are similar to levels <BR>seen at 4 to 5 weeks. <BR>                        The long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine assure that, <BR>even when dosing is stopped, active drug substance will persist in the body for <BR>weeks (primarily depending on individual patient characteristics, previous <BR>dosing regimen and length of previous therapy at discontinuation). This is of <BR>potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are <BR>prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the <BR>discontinuation of fluoxetine. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.4 Specific Populations<BR>                     <BR>                        Liver DiseaseAs might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver <BR>impairment can affect the elimination of fluoxetine. The elimination half-life <BR>of fluoxetine was prolonged in a study of cirrhotic patients, with a mean of 7.6 <BR>days compared with the range of 2 to 3 days seen in subjects without liver <BR>disease; norfluoxetine elimination was also delayed, with a mean duration of 12 <BR>days for cirrhotic patients compared with the range of 7 to 9 days in normal <BR>subjects. This suggests that the use of fluoxetine in patients with liver <BR>disease must be approached with caution. If fluoxetine is administered to <BR>patients with liver disease, a lower or less frequent dose should be used [see <BR>                                 Dosage and <BR>Administration (2.7)<BR>                              , <BR>                                 Use in Specific <BR>Populations (8.6)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Renal DiseaseIn depressed patients on dialysis (N = 12), fluoxetine <BR>administered as 20 mg once daily for 2 months produced steady-state fluoxetine <BR>and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations comparable with those seen in patients <BR>with normal renal function. While the possibility exists that renally excreted <BR>metabolites of fluoxetine may accumulate to higher levels in patients with <BR>severe renal dysfunction, use of a lower or less frequent dose is not routinely <BR>necessary in renally impaired patients. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Geriatric PharmacokineticsThe disposition of single doses of fluoxetine in healthy elderly <BR>subjects (> 65 years of age) did not differ significantly from that in <BR>younger normal subjects. However, given the long half-life and nonlinear <BR>disposition of the drug, a single-dose study is not adequate to rule out the <BR>possibility of altered pharmacokinetics in the elderly, particularly if they <BR>have systemic illness or are receiving multiple drugs for concomitant diseases. <BR>The effects of age upon the metabolism of fluoxetine have been investigated in <BR>260 elderly but otherwise healthy depressed patients (> 60 years of age) who <BR>received 20 mg fluoxetine for 6 weeks. Combined fluoxetine plus norfluoxetine <BR>plasma concentrations were 209.3 ± 85.7 ng/mL at the end of 6 weeks. No unusual <BR>age-associated pattern of adverse reactions was observed in those elderly <BR>patients.<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Pediatric Pharmacokinetics (children and <BR>adolescents)Fluoxetine pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 21 pediatric <BR>patients (ten children ages 6 to < 13, 11 adolescents ages 13 to < 18) <BR>diagnosed with major depressive disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). <BR>Fluoxetine 20 mg/day was administered for up to 62 days. The average <BR>steady-state concentrations of fluoxetine in these children were 2-fold higher <BR>than in adolescents (171 and 86 ng/mL, respectively). The average norfluoxetine <BR>steady-state concentrations in these children were 1.5-fold higher than in <BR>adolescents (195 and 113 ng/mL, respectively). These differences can be almost <BR>entirely explained by differences in weight. No gender-associated difference in <BR>fluoxetine pharmacokinetics was observed. Similar ranges of fluoxetine and <BR>norfluoxetine plasma concentrations were observed in another study in 94 <BR>pediatric patients (ages 8 to < 18) diagnosed with major depressive disorder. <BR><BR>                        Higher average steady-state fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations were <BR>observed in children relative to adults; however, these concentrations were <BR>within the range of concentrations observed in the adult population. As in <BR>adults, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine accumulated extensively following multiple <BR>oral dosing; steady-state concentrations were achieved within 3 to 4 weeks of <BR>daily dosing. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
