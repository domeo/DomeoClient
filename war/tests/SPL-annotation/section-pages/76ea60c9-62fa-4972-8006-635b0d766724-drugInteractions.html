No interactions were observed with either ranitidine or lansoprazole.<BR>                        Substrates or Inhibitors of CYP1A2<BR>                        Blood levels and/ or toxicity of propranolol may be increased by coadministration with substrates or inhibitors of CYP1A2, such as imipramine, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, ritonavir, theophylline, zileuton, zolmitriptan, and rizatriptan.<BR>                        Substrates or Inhibitors of CYP2C19<BR>                        Blood levels and/ or toxicity of propranolol may be increased by coadministration with substrates or inhibitors of CYP2C19, such as fluconazole, cimetidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, tenioposide, and tolbutamide.

Cigarette smoking also induces hepatic metabolism and has been shown to increase up to 77% the clearance of propranolol, resulting in decreased plasma concentrations.<BR>                        Cardiovascular Drugs<BR>                        <BR>                           Antiarrhythmics<BR>                        <BR>                        The AUC of propafenone is increased by more than 200% by coadministration of propranolol.<BR>                        The metabolism of propranolol is reduced by coadministration of quinidine, leading to a two-three fold increased blood concentration and greater degrees of clinical beta-blockade.<BR>                        The metabolism of lidocaine is inhibited by coadministration of propranolol, resulting in a 25% increase in lidocaine concentrations.<BR>                        <BR>                           Calcium Channel Blockers<BR>                        <BR>                        The mean Cmax and AUC of propranolol are increased respectively, by 50% and 30% by coadministration of nisoldipine and by 80% and 47%, by coadministration of nicardipine.<BR>                        The mean Cmax and AUC of nifedipine are increased by 64% and 79%, respectively, by coadministration of propranolol.<BR>                        Propranolol does not affect the pharmacokinetics of verapamil and norverapamil. Verapamil does not affect the pharmacokinetics of propranolol.<BR>                        Non-Cardiovascular Drugs<BR>                        <BR>                           Migraine Drugs<BR>                        <BR>                        Administration of zolmitriptan or rizatriptan with propranolol resulted in increased concentrations of zolmitriptan (AUC increased by 56% and Cmax by 37%) or rizatriptan (the AUC and Cmax were increased by 67% and 75%, respectively).<BR>                        <BR>                           Theophylline<BR>                        <BR>                        Coadministration of theophylline with propranolol decreases theophylline oral clearance by 30% to 52%.<BR>                        <BR>                           Benzodiazepines<BR>                        <BR>                        Propranolol can inhibit the metabolism of diazepam, resulting in increased concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites.
