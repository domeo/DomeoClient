Its molecular formula is C17H19N3O3S, with a molecular weight of 345.42. The structural formula is: <BR>                  <BR>                  Omeprazole, USP is a white to off-white crystalline powder which melts with decomposition at about 155Â°C. It is a weak base, freely soluble in ethanol and methanol, and slightly soluble in acetone and isopropanol and very slightly soluble in water. The stability of omeprazole is a function of pH; it is rapidly degraded in acid media, but has acceptable stability under alkaline conditions. <BR>                  Omeprazole is supplied as delayed-release capsules for oral administration. Each delayed-release capsule contains either 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg of omeprazole, USP in the form of enteric-coated granules with the following inactive ingredients: ammonium hydroxide, dibutyl sebacate, ethylcellulose, fumed silica, hypromellose, methacrylic acid, oleic acid, sugar spheres, talc, titanium dioxide and triethyl citrate. The empty gelatin capsule shells contain D&C Yellow No. 10, FD&C Green No. 3, gelatin, silicon dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide. The 40 mg empty gelatin capsule shell also contains FD&C Blue No. 1. In addition, the white imprinting ink contains ammonium hydroxide, pharmaceutical glaze, simethicone and titanium dioxide.<BR>                  Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules USP, 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg meet USP Drug Release Test 2.<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     Structural Formula<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
