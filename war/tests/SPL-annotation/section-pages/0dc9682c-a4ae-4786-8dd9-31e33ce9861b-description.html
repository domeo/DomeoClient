Its empirical formula is C17H19N3O3S, with a molecular weight of 345.42. The structural formula is:<BR>                  <BR>                  Omeprazole is a white to off-white crystalline powder that melts with decomposition at about 155Â°C. It is a weak base, freely soluble in ethanol and methanol, and slightly soluble in acetone and isopropanol and very slightly soluble in water. The stability of omeprazole is a function of pH; it is rapidly degraded in acid media, but has acceptable stability under alkaline conditions.<BR>                  Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules meet USP Dissolution Test 2.<BR>                  Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules are for oral administration. Each delayed-release capsule contains either 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg of omeprazole in the form of enteric-coated microtablets with the following inactive ingredients: crospovidone, glyceryl behenate, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, methacrylic acid copolymer dispersion, silicon dioxide, talc, titanium dioxide and triethyl citrate. The capsule shells have the following inactive ingredients: gelatin, titanium dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate, synthetic black iron oxide, shellac glaze, and other inactive ingredients. In addition, the 20 mg and 40 mg capsules shells also contain yellow iron oxide.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     Omeprazole Structural Formula<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
