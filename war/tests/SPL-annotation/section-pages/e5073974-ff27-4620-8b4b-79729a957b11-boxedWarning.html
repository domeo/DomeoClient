Anyone considering the use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Fluvoxamine maleate tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients except for patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) [see Warnings and Precautions, Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk (5.1)].<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        Warning: Suicidality and Antidepressants<BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.<BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                        Increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders.
