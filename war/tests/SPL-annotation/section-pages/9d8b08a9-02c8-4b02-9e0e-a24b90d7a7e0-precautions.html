Carisoprodol is dialyzable by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 Seizures<BR>											<BR>                                 <BR>                                    There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol.
