Appropriate management of therapy and complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available.<BR><BR>                  Cumulative renal toxicity associated with PLATINOL is severe. Other major dose-related toxicities are myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting.<BR><BR>                  Ototoxicity, which may be more pronounced in children, and is manifested by tinnitus, and/or loss of high frequency hearing and occasionally deafness, is significant.<BR><BR>                  <BR>                     Anaphylactic-like reactions to PLATINOL have been reported. Facial edema, bronchoconstriction, tachycardia, and hypotension may occur within minutes of PLATINOL administration. Epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines have been effectively employed to alleviate symptoms (see <BR>                        WARNINGS<BR>                      and <BR>                        ADVERSE REACTIONS<BR>                     ).<BR><BR>                  <BR>                     Exercise caution to prevent inadvertent PLATINOL overdose. Doses greater than 100 mg/m2/cycle once every 3 to 4 weeks are rarely used. Care must be taken to avoid inadvertent PLATINOL overdose due to confusion with PARAPLATIN® (carboplatin) or prescribing practices that fail to differentiate daily doses from total dose per cycle.<BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
