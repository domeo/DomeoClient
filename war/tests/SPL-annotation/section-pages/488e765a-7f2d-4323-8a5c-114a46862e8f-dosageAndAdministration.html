Although a higher dose regimen in poor metabolizers increases antiplatelet response [see <BR>                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)], an appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been established. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.4 Use with Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI)<BR>                     <BR>                        Avoid using omeprazole or esomeprazole with clopidogrel tablets. Omeprazole and esomeprazole significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel tablets. When concomitant administration of a PPI is required, consider using another acid-reducing agent with minimal or no CYP2C19 inhibitory effect on the formation of clopidogrel active metabolite [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (<BR>                           <BR>                              12.3<BR>                           <BR>                           )].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
