Anyone considering the use of doxepin or any other <BR>antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk <BR>with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk <BR>of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; <BR>there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults <BR>aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are <BR>themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all <BR>ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately <BR>and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in <BR>behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close <BR>observation and communication with the prescriber. Doxepin is not approved for <BR>use in pediatric patients.
