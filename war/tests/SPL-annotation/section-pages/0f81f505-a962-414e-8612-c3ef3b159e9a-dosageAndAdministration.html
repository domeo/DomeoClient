Therapy should be discontinued 30 days after achievement of complete remission or after 90 days of treatment, whichever occurs first.<BR>                  If after initiation of treatment of tretinoin the presence of the t(15;17) translocation is not confirmed by cytogenetics and/or by polymerase chain reaction studies and the patient has not responded to tretinoin, alternative therapy appropriate for acute myelogenous leukemia should be considered.<BR>                  <BR>                     Tretinoin is for the induction of remission only. Optimal consolidation or maintenance regimens have not been determined. All patients should, therefore, receive a standard consolidation and/or maintenance chemotherapy regimen for APL after induction therapy with tretinoin, unless otherwise contraindicated.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
