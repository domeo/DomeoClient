Its empirical formula is C16H14F2N3NaO4S x 1.5 H2O, with a molecular weight of 432.4. The structural formula is: <BR>                  <BR>                  Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is a white to off-white crystalline powder and is racemic. Pantoprazole has weakly basic and acidic properties. Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is freely soluble in water, very slightly soluble in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, and practically insoluble in n-hexane. <BR>                  The stability of the compound in aqueous solution is pH-dependent. The rate of degradation increases with decreasing pH. At ambient temperature, the degradation half-life is approximately 2.8 hours at pH 5 and approximately 220 hours at pH 7.8. <BR>                  PROTONIX (pantoprazole sodium) is supplied as a for delayed-release oral suspension, available in one strength (40 mg), and as a delayed-release tablet, available in two strengths (20 mg and 40 mg). <BR>                  Each PROTONIX (pantoprazole sodium) Delayed-Release Tablet contains 45.1 mg or 22.56 mg of pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (equivalent to 40 mg or 20 mg pantoprazole, respectively) with the following inactive ingredients: calcium stearate, crospovidone, hypromellose, iron oxide, mannitol, methacrylic acid copolymer, polysorbate 80, povidone, propylene glycol, sodium carbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide, and triethyl citrate. PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets (40 mg and 20 mg) complies with USP dissolution test 2.<BR>                  PROTONIX (pantoprazole sodium) For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension, 40 mg, contains the active ingredient pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate in the form of enteric‑coated granules in unit dose packets. Each unit dose packet contains enteric-coated granules containing 45.1 mg pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (equivalent to 40 mg of pantoprazole) with the following inactive ingredients: crospovidone, hypromellose, methacrylic acid copolymer, microcrystalline cellulose, polysorbate 80, povidone, sodium carbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate, and yellow ferric oxide. <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     Chemical Structure<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
