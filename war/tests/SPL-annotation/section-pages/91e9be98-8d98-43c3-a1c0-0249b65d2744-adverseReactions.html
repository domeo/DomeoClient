Three serious adverse events were reported in<BR>the patients given isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide as separate tablets and capsules. The three serious adverse events were two<BR>general hypersensitivity reactions and one jaundice reaction.<BR>There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in standard liver function, renal function and hematological<BR>laboratory test values measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. As would be expected for these drugs, there were<BR>alterations in liver enzymes (SGOT, SGPT) and serum uric acid levels. The adverse reactions reported during therapy with RIFATER<BR>are consistent with those described below for the individual components.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Adverse Reactions Reported for Individual Components<BR>Rifampin<BR>Heartburn, epigastric distress, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, flatulence, cramps, and diarrhea have been noted in some patients.<BR>Although Clostridium difficile has been shown in vitro to be sensitive to rifampin, pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with<BR>the use of rifampin (and other broad spectrum antibiotics). Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who develop<BR>diarrhea in association with antibiotic use. Rarely, hepatitis or a shocklike syndrome with hepatic involvement and abnormal liver<BR>function tests has been reported.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Hematologic<BR>Thrombocytopenia has occurred primarily with high dose intermittent therapy, but has also been noted after resumption of interrupted<BR>treatment. It rarely occurs during well-supervised daily therapy. This effect is reversible if the drug is discontinued as soon as purpura<BR>occurs. Cerebral hemorrhage and fatalities have been reported when rifampin administration has been continued or resumed after the<BR>appearance of purpura. Leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, and decreased hemoglobin have been observed. Agranulocytosis has been reported rarely.<BR>Central Nervous System Headache, fever, drowsiness, fatigue, ataxia, dizziness, inability to concentrate, mental confusion, behavioral changes, muscular weakness, pains in extremities, and generalized numbness have been observed.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Rare reports of myopathy have also been observed.<BR>Ocular Visual disturbances have been observed.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Endocrine Menstrual disturbances have been observed.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Renal<BR>Elevations in BUN and serum uric acid have been reported. Rarely, hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, hematuria, interstitial nephritis, renal<BR>insufficiency, and acute renal failure have been noted. These are generally considered to be hypersensitivity reactions. They usually<BR>occur during intermittent therapy or when treatment is resumed following intentional or accidental interruption of a daily dosage<BR>regimen, and are reversible when rifampin is discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Dermatologic<BR>Cutaneous reactions are mild and self-limiting and do not appear to be hypersensitivity reactions. Typically, they consist of flushing<BR>and itching with or without a rash. More serious cutaneous reactions which may be due to hypersensitivity occur but are uncommon.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Hypersensitivity Reactions<BR>Occasionally pruritus, urticaria, rash, pemphigoid reaction, eosinophilia, sore mouth, sore tongue and conjunctivitis have been<BR>observed.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Miscellaneous<BR>Edema of the face and extremities have been reported. Other reactions which have occurred with intermittent dosage regimens include<BR>"flu" syndrome (such as episodes of fever, chills, headache, dizziness, and bone pain), shortness of breath, wheezing, decrease in<BR>blood pressure and shock. The "flu" syndrome may also appear if rifampin is taken irregularly by the patient or if daily administration<BR>is resumed after a drug free interval.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Isoniazid<BR>The most frequent reactions are those affecting the nervous system and the liver. See the boxed WARNING.<BR>Nervous System<BR>Peripheral neuropathy is the most common toxic effect. It is dose-related, occurs most often in the malnourished and in those<BR>predisposed to neuritis (eg, alcoholics and diabetics), and is usually preceded by paresthesia of the feet and hands. The incidence is<BR>higher in "slow inactivators."<BR>Other neurotoxic effects, which are uncommon with conventional doses, are convulsions, toxic encephalopathy, optic neuritis and<BR>atrophy, memory impairment, and toxic psychosis.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Gastrointestinal Nausea, vomiting, and epigastric distress.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Hepatic<BR>Elevated serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT), bilirubinemia, bilirubinuria, jaundice, and occasionally severe and sometimes fatal<BR>hepatitis. The common prodromal symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, and weakness. Mild and transient<BR>elevation of serum transaminase levels occurs in 10 to 20% of persons taking isoniazid. The abnormality usually occurs in the first 4<BR>to 6 months of treatment but can occur at any time during therapy. In most instances, enzyme levels return to normal with no necessity<BR>to discontinue medication. In occasional instances, progressive liver damage occurs, with accompanying symptoms. In these cases, the<BR>drug should be discontinued immediately. The frequency of progressive liver damage increases with age. It is rare in persons under<BR>20, but occurs in up to 2.3% of those over 50 years of age.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Hematologic<BR>Agranulocytosis; hemolytic, sideroblastic, or aplastic anemia; thrombocytopenia; and eosinophilia.<BR>Hypersensitivity Reactions<BR>Fever, skin eruptions (morbilliform, maculopapular, purpuric, or exfoliative), lymphadenopathy, and vasculitis.<BR>Metabolic and Endocrine Pyridoxine deficiency, pellagra, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and gynecomastia.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Miscellaneous<BR>Rheumatic syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Pyrazinamide<BR>The principal adverse effect is a hepatic reaction (see WARNINGS). Hepatotoxicity appears to be dose related and may appear at any<BR>time during therapy. Pyrazinamide can cause hyperuricemia and gout (see PRECAUTIONS).<BR>Gastrointestinal GI disturbances including nausea, vomiting, and anorexia have also been reported.<BR>Hematologic and Lymphatic<BR>Thrombocytopenia and sideroblastic anemia with erythroid hyperplasia, vacuolation of erythrocytes and increased serum<BR>concentration have occurred rarely with this drug. Adverse effects on blood clotting mechanisms have also been rarely reported.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Other<BR>Mild arthralgia and myalgia have been reported frequently. Hypersensitivity reactions including rashes, urticaria, pruritus, and<BR>erythema have been reported. Angioedema has been reported rarely. Fever, acne, photosensitivity, porphyria, dysuria, and interstitial<BR>nephritis have been reported rarely.<BR><BR>                  <BR>                     <BR><BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
