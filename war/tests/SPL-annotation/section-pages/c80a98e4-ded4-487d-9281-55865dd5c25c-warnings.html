Deaths <BR>associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from <BR>agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood <BR>counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA <BR>Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be <BR>done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually <BR>thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis <BR>is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. <BR>Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of <BR>hematologic reactions; if co-administered with Dapsone the patient should be <BR>monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have <BR>developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. <BR>                  Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin <BR>monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with <BR>severe cardiopulmonary disease. <BR>                  Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and <BR>are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone <BR>therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include <BR>toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform <BR>and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic <BR>dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and <BR>appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, <BR>are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require <BR>discontinuation. See special section. <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
