This may lead to reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) over time. The lower the BMD, the greater the risk of osteoporosis and fracture.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                        LAB-0098-14.0<BR>                        <BR>                           FDA- Approved Patient Labeling<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Logo<BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
