During the pre- and postnatal development studies in the offspring, development of the offspring, including fertility and reproductive performance, was not affected by the maternal administration of maraviroc.<BR>                              However, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, SELZENTRY should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry<BR>                              <BR>                              To monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to SELZENTRY and other antiretroviral agents, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established.

Studies in lactating rats indicate that maraviroc is extensively secreted into rat milk. It is not known whether maraviroc is secreted into human milk. Because of the potential for both HIV transmission and serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving SELZENTRY. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4 Pediatric Use <BR>                     <BR>                        The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of maraviroc in patients <16 years of age have not been established. Therefore, maraviroc should not be used in this patient population.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5 Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        There were insufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over in the clinical studies to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised when administering SELZENTRY in elderly patients, also reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic and renal function, of concomitant disease and other drug therapy.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.6 Renal Impairment <BR>                     <BR>                         Recommended doses of SELZENTRY for patients with impaired renal function (CrCl â‰¤ 80 mL/min) are based on the results of a pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy subjects with various degrees of renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment was similar to that in subjects with normal renal function [see <BR>                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           ]. A limited number of subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment in the Phase 3 clinical trials (n= 131 and n= 12, respectively) received the same dose of SELZENTRY as that administered to subjects with normal renal function. In these subjects there was no apparent difference in the adverse event profile for maraviroc compared to subjects with normal renal function.<BR>                          If patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) not receiving a concomitant potent CYP3A inhibitor or inducer experience any symptoms of postural hypotension while taking SELZENTRY 300 mg twice daily, the dose should be reduced to 150 mg twice daily. No studies have been performed in subjects with severe renal impairment or ESRD co-treated with potent CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. Hence, no dose of SELZENTRY can be recommended, and SELZENTRY is contraindicated for these patients. [see <BR>                              Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4),  Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           ].  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.7 Hepatic Impairment  <BR>                     <BR>                        Maraviroc is principally metabolized by the liver; therefore, caution should be exercised when administering this drug to patients with hepatic impairment, because maraviroc concentrations may be increased. Maraviroc concentrations are higher when SELZENTRY 150 mg is administered with a potent CYP3A inhibitor compared to following administration of 300 mg without a CYP3A inhibitor, so<BR>patients with moderate hepatic impairment who receive SELZENTRY 150 mg with a potent CYP3A<BR>inhibitor should be monitored closely for maraviroc-associated adverse events. Maraviroc has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment  [see <BR>                              Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.8 Gender<BR>                     <BR>                        Population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled Phase 1/2a data indicated gender (female: n=96, 23.2% of the total population) does not affect maraviroc concentrations. Dosage adjustment based on gender is not necessary.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.9 Race<BR>                     <BR>                        Population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled Phase 1/2a data indicated exposure was 26.5% higher in Asians (N=95) as compared to non-Asians (n=318). However, a study designed to evaluate pharmacokinetic differences between Caucasians (n=12) and Singaporeans (n=12) showed no difference between these two populations. No dose adjustment based on race is needed.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
