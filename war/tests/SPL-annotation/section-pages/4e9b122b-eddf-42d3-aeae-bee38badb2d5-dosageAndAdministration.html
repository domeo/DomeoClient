Dosage may subsequently be <BR>increased or decreased at appropriate intervals and according to individual <BR>response. The usual optimum dose range is 75 mg/day to 150 mg/day.<BR>                  In more severely ill patients higher doses may be required with subsequent <BR>gradual increase to 300 mg/day if necessary. Additional therapeutic effect is <BR>rarely to be obtained by exceeding a dose of 300 mg/day.<BR>                  In patients with very mild symptomatology or emotional symptoms accompanying <BR>organic disease, lower doses may suffice. Some of these patients have been <BR>controlled on doses as low as 25 to 50 mg/day.<BR>                  The total daily dosage of doxepin (as the hydrochloride) may be given on a <BR>divided or once a day dosage schedule. If the once a day schedule is employed <BR>the maximum recommended dose is 150 mg/day. This dose may be given at bedtime. <BR>The 150 mg capsule strength is intended for maintenance therapy only and is not <BR>recommended for initiation of treatment.<BR>                  Antianxiety effect is apparent before the antidepressant effect. Optimal <BR>antidepressant effect may not be evident for two to three weeks.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
