There are no adequate and well-controlled <BR>studies with dexlansoprazole in pregnant women. There were no adverse fetal <BR>effects in animal reproduction studies of dexlansoprazole in rabbits. Because <BR>animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, KAPIDEX <BR>should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.<BR>                  A reproduction study conducted in rabbits at oral dexlansoprazole doses up to <BR>30 mg per kg per day (approximately 9-fold the maximum recommended human <BR>dexlansoprazole dose [60 mg] based on body surface area [BSA]) revealed no <BR>evidence of harm to the fetus due to dexlansoprazole. In addition, reproduction <BR>studies performed in pregnant rats with oral lansoprazole at doses up to 150 mg <BR>per kg per day (40 times the recommended human dose based on BSA) and in <BR>pregnant rabbits at oral lansoprazole doses up to 30 mg per kg per day (16 times <BR>the recommended human dose based on BSA) revealed no evidence of impaired <BR>fertility or harm to the fetus due to lansoprazole.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  8.3 Nursing MothersIt is not known whether dexlansoprazole is excreted in human <BR>milk. However, lansoprazole and its metabolites are present in rat milk <BR>following the administration of lansoprazole. As many drugs are excreted in <BR>human milk, and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for <BR>lansoprazole in rat carcinogenicity studies [see Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility <BR>(13.1)], a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or <BR>to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the <BR>mother.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of KAPIDEX in pediatric patients (less <BR>than 18 years of age) have not been established.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  8.5 Geriatric UseIn clinical studies of KAPIDEX, 11% of patients were aged 65 <BR>years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed <BR>between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical <BR>experience has not identified significant differences in responses between <BR>geriatric and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older <BR>individuals cannot be ruled out [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  8.6 Renal ImpairmentNo dosage adjustment of KAPIDEX is necessary in patients with <BR>renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole in patients with renal <BR>impairment are not expected to be altered since dexlansoprazole is extensively <BR>metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites, and no parent drug is <BR>recovered in the urine following an oral dose of dexlansoprazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  8.7 Hepatic ImpairmentNo dosage adjustment for KAPIDEX is necessary for patients with <BR>mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). KAPIDEX 30 mg should be considered <BR>for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). No studies <BR>have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class <BR>C) [see Clinical Pharmacology <BR>(12.5)].<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
