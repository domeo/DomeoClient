The CAPRIE study (Clopidogrel vs. Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) was a comparison of Plavix to aspirin. The CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Ischemic Events) and the COMMIT/CCS-2 (Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction Trial / Second Chinese Cardiac Study) studies were comparisons of Plavix to placebo, given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy. The CHARISMA (Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance) study (n=15,603) also compared Plavix to placebo, given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     14.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              CURE<BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                        The CURE study included 12,562 patients with ACS without ST-elevation (UA or NSTEMI) and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischemia. Patients were required to have either ECG changes compatible with new ischemia (without ST-elevation) or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or T to at least twice the upper limit of normal. The patient population was largely Caucasian (82%) and included 38% women, and 52% patients ≥65 years of age.<BR>                        Patients were randomized to receive Plavix (300-mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily) or placebo, and were treated for up to one year. Patients also received aspirin (75–325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies such as heparin. The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors was not permitted for three days prior to randomization.<BR>                        The number of patients experiencing the primary outcome (CV death, MI, or stroke) was 582 (9.3%) in the Plavix-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the placebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10%–28%; p < 0.001) for the Plavix-treated group (see Table 4).<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ID="id_c0e4b4c3-cb2c-48d2-8e95-8e64bd6db316"><BR>                           <caption ID="id_0c2a1b03-a362-4d8c-a01a-f55d4cc9dfe4">Table 4: Outcome Events in the CURE Primary Analysis</caption><BR>                           <col width="31%" align="left"/><BR>                           <col width="23%" align="center"/><BR>                           <col width="23%" align="center"/><BR>                           <col width="23%" align="center"/><BR>                           <thead><BR>                              <tr ID="id_64c0d171-bef2-4719-8087-756e86bac6bf" styleCode="Toprule"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule">Outcome</td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">Plavix<br/> (+ aspirin)<footnote ID="id-d4f9d6dc-d751-4784-bd35-e27ace5a54fa">Other standard therapies were used as appropriate.</footnote><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">Placebo<br/> (+ aspirin)<footnoteRef IDREF="id-d4f9d6dc-d751-4784-bd35-e27ace5a54fa"/><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule">Relative Risk<br/> Reduction (%)<br/> (95% CI)</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_da2156f5-73ae-4b53-85cb-f35c680bd092" styleCode="Botrule"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Rrule"/><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Rrule">(n=6259)</td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Rrule">(n=6303)</td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Rrule"/><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </thead><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr ID="id_e163d207-0af7-4cd6-99bb-902e9b33e314" styleCode="Toprule"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule">Primary outcome<br/>&#160;&#160;(Cardiovascular death, MI, stroke)</td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Toprule">582&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(9.3%)</td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Toprule">719 (11.4%)</td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Rrule">20%<br/> (10.3, 27.9)<br/> p &lt;

The benefits associated with Plavix were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of Plavix was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75–325 mg once daily).

The use of Plavix in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting), (2253 patients [36.0%] in the Plavix group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).<BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                    COMMIT<BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                              In patients with STEMI, the safety and efficacy of Plavix were evaluated in the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, COMMIT.

The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 3-year follow-up period.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Figure 7: Fatal or Non-Fatal Vascular Events in the CAPRIE Study<BR>                              <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              The statistical significance favoring Plavix over aspirin was marginal (p=0.045). However, because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke, the effect of Plavix is substantial.<BR>                              The CAPRIE trial included a population that was randomized on the basis of 3 entry criteria. The efficacy of Plavix relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these randomized subgroups (p=0.043). It is not clear whether this difference is real or a chance occurrence. Although the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of Plavix over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups, the benefit appeared to be strongest in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral vascular disease (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) and weaker in stroke patients. In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction, Plavix was not numerically superior to aspirin.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     14.3 Lack of Established Benefit of Plavix plus Aspirin in Patients with Multiple Risk Factors or Established Vascular Disease<BR>                     <BR>                         CHARISMA <BR>                        The CHARISMA trial was a 15,603 subject, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study comparing Plavix (75 mg daily) to placebo for prevention of ischemic events in patients with vascular disease or multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis. All subjects were treated with aspirin 75–162 mg daily. The mean duration of treatment was 23 months. The study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the occurrence of the primary endpoint, a composite of CV death, MI, or stroke. A total of 534 (6.9%) patients in the Plavix group versus 573 (7.4%) patients in the placebo group experienced a primary outcome event (p=0.22).
