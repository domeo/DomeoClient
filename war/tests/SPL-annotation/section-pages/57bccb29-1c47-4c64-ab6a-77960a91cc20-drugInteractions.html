Co-treatment with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increased erlotinib AUC by 2/3. When TARCEVA was co-administered with ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, the erlotinib exposure [AUC] and maximum concentration [Cmax] increased by 39% and 17% respectively. Caution should be used when administering or taking TARCEVA with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), voriconazole and grapefruit or grapefruit juice [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].<BR>                  Pre-treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin for 7 days prior to TARCEVA decreased erlotinib AUC by about 2/3 to 4/5, which is equivalent to a dose of about 30 to 50 mg in NSCLC patients. In a separate study, treatment with rifampicin for 11 days, with co-administration of a single 450 mg dose of TARCEVA on day 8 resulted in a mean erlotinib exposure (AUC) that was 57.6% of that observed following a single 150 mg TARCEVA dose in the absence of rifampicin treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].  Use of alternative treatments lacking CYP3A4 inducing activity is strongly recommended. If an alternative treatment is unavailable, adjusting the starting dose should be considered. If the TARCEVA dose is adjusted upward, the dose will need to be reduced immediately to the indicated starting dose upon discontinuation of rifampicin or other inducers. Other CYP3A4 inducers include, but are not limited to, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John's Wort [see Dosage and Administration (<BR>                           2.3<BR>                        )].<BR>                  <BR>                  Cigarette smoking has been shown to reduce erlotinib AUC. Patients should be advised to stop smoking; however, if they continue to smoke, a cautious increase in the dose of TARCEVA may be considered, while monitoring the patient’s safety. If the TARCEVA dose is adjusted upward, the dose should be reduced immediately to the indicated starting dose upon cessation of smoking [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                  <BR>                  Pretreatment and co-administration of TARCEVA decreased the AUC of CYP3A4 substrate, midazolam, by 24%. The mechanism is not clear.<BR>                  In a study, there were no significant effects of gemcitabine on the pharmacokinetics of erlotinib nor were there significant effects of erlotinib on the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine.<BR>                  Drugs that alter the pH of the upper GI tract may alter the solubility of erlotinib and reduce its bioavailability. Increasing the dose of TARCEVA when co-administered with such agents is not likely to compensate for the loss of exposure. Co-administration of TARCEVA with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, decreased the erlotinib AUC by 46%. Since proton pump inhibitors affect pH of the upper GI tract for an extended period, separation of doses may not eliminate the interaction. The concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors with TARCEVA should be avoided if possible. Co-administration of TARCEVA with 300 mg ranitidine, an H2 receptor antagonist, decreased erlotinib AUC by 33%. When TARCEVA was administered with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily (at least 10 h after the previous ranitidine evening dose and 2 h before the ranitidine morning dose), the erlotinib AUC decreased by 15%.  If patients need to be treated with an H2-receptor antagonist such as ranitidine, it should be used in a staggered manner.  TARCEVA must be taken once a day, 10 hours after the H2-receptor antagonist dosing and at least 2 hours before the next dose of H2-receptor antagonist. Although the effect of antacids on erlotinib pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated, the antacid dose and the TARCEVA dose should be separated by several hours, if an antacid is necessary. [see  Clinical Pharmacology (<BR>                           12.3<BR>                        )].<BR>                  <BR>                  Interaction with coumarin-derived anticoagulants, including wafarin, leading to increased International Normalized Ratio (INR) and bleeding events, which in some cases were fatal, have been reported in patients receiving TARCEVA. Patients taking coumarin derived anticoagulants should be monitored regularly for any changes in prothrombin time or INR [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].<BR>                  The combination of TARCEVA and a statin may increase the potential for statin-induced myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, which was observed rarely. The mechanism of this interaction is not clear. <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase erlotinib plasma concentrations.

(7)<BR>                           Erlotinib solubility is pH dependent. Drugs that alter the pH of the upper GI tract may alter the solubility of erlotinib and hence its absorption.
