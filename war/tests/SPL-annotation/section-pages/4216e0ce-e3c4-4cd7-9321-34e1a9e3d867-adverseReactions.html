It is dose-related, occurs most often in the malnourished and in those predisposed to neuritis (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics), and is usually preceded by paresthesias of the feet and hands. The incidence is higher in "slow inactivators".<BR>Other neurotoxic effects, which are uncommon with conventional doses, are convulsions, toxic encephalopathy, optic neuritis and atrophy, memory impairment, and toxic psychosis.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Hepatic Reactions<BR><BR>                     See boxed warning<BR><BR>                     <BR><BR>                     Gastrointestinal Reactions<BR><BR>                     Nausea, vomiting, and epigastric distress.<BR><BR>                     <BR><BR>                     Hematologic Reactions<BR><BR>                     <BR>                     <BR><BR>                     <BR><BR>                     Hypersensitivity Reactions<BR><BR>                     Fever, skin eruptions (morbilliform, maculopapular, purpuric, or exfoliative), lymphadenopathy, and vasculitis.<BR><BR>                     <BR><BR>                     Metabolic and Endocrine Reactions<BR><BR>                     Pyridoxine deficiency, pellagra, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and gynecomastia.<BR><BR>                     <BR><BR>                     Miscellaneous Reactions<BR><BR>                     Rheumatic syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome.<BR><BR>                     <BR><BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
