Subsequent studies intended to demonstrate an increase in survival have been unsuccessful.  Specifically, results from a large placebo-controlled randomized trial in patients with advanced NSCLC who progressed while receiving or within 90 days of the last dose of chemotherapy or were intolerant to the most recent prior chemotherapy regimen, did not show an improvement in survival (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY- Clinical Studies section).<BR>                  Results from two large, controlled, randomized trials in first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer showed no benefit from adding IRESSA to doublet, platinum-based chemotherapy. <BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
