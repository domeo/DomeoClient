Concomitant administration of atorvastatin with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin.

Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the atorvastatin dose exceeds 20 mg [see <BR>                              Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)<BR>                            and <BR>                              Dosage and Administration (2.6)]<BR>                           .<BR>                        <BR>                           Combination of Protease Inhibitors: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitiors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of  atorvastatin alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of atorvastatin should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing atorvastatin and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of atorvastatin should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution [see <BR>                              Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)<BR>                            and <BR>                              Dosage and Administration (2.6)]<BR>                           .<BR>                        <BR>                           Itraconazole: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
