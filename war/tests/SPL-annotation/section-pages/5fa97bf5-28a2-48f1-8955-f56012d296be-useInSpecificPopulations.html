REVLIMID is a thalidomide analogue.  <BR>                        Thalidomide is a human teratogen, inducing a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects such as amelia (absence of limbs), phocomelia (short limbs), hypoplasticity of the bones, absence of bones, external ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals), facial palsy, eye abnormalities (anophthalmos, microphthalmos), and congenital heart defects. Alimentary tract, urinary tract, and genital malformations have also been documented and mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants. <BR>                        Lenalidomide caused thalidomide-type limb defects in monkey offspring.  If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus<BR>                        If pregnancy does occur during treatment, immediately discontinue the drug. Under these conditions, refer patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure to REVLIMID must be reported to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-332-1088 and also to Celgene Corporation at 1-888-423-5436.<BR>                        <BR>                           Animal data<BR>                        <BR>                        In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in monkeys, teratogenicity, including thalidomide-like limb defects, occurred in offspring when pregnant monkeys received oral lenalidomide during organogenesis at doses approximately 0.17 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 25 mg, based on body surface area.  Similar studies in pregnant rabbits and rats at 20 times and 200 times the MRHD respectively, produced embryo lethality in rabbits and no adverse reproductive effects in rats.<BR>                        In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, animals received lenalidomide from organogenesis through lactation.  The study revealed a few adverse effects on the offspring of female rats treated with lenalidomide at doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 200 times the human dose of 25 mg based on body surface area). The male offspring exhibited slightly delayed sexual maturation and the female offspring had slightly lower body weight gains during gestation when bred to male offspring. As with thalidomide, the rat model may not adequately address the full spectrum of potential human embryo-fetal developmental effects for lenalidomide.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3	Nursing mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from lenalidomide, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4	Pediatric use<BR>                     <BR>                        Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5	Geriatric use<BR>                     <BR>                        REVLIMID has been used in multiple myeloma (MM) clinical trials in patients up to 86 years of age. <BR>                        Of the 703 MM patients who received study treatment in Studies 1 and 2, 45% were age 65 or over while 12% of patients were age 75 and over. The percentage of patients age 65 or over was not significantly different between the REVLIMID/dexamethasone and placebo/dexamethasone groups. Of the 353 patients who received REVLIMID/dexamethasone, 46% were age 65 and over. In both studies, patients > 65 years of age were more likely than patients ≤ 65 years of age to experience DVT, pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, and renal failure following use of REVLIMID. No differences in efficacy were observed between patients over 65 years of age and younger patients. <BR>                        REVLIMID has been used in del 5q MDS clinical trials in patients up to 95 years of age.<BR>                        Of the 148 patients with del 5q MDS enrolled in the major study, 38% were age 65 and over, while 33% were age 75 and over. Although the overall frequency of adverse events (100%) was the same in patients over 65 years of age as in younger patients, the frequency of serious adverse events was higher in patients over 65 years of age than in younger patients (54% vs. 33%). A greater proportion of patients over 65 years of age discontinued from the clinical studies because of adverse events than the proportion of younger patients (27% vs.16%). No differences in efficacy were observed between patients over 65 years of age and younger patients.<BR>                        Since elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection.

Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy 4 weeks before therapy, while taking REVLIMID, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy. <BR>                        <BR>                           Females<BR>                           <BR>Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control simultaneously (one highly effective form of contraception – tubal ligation, IUD, hormonal (birth control pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal rings or implants) or partner’s vasectomy and one additional effective contraceptive method – male latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm or cervical cap.  Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with REVLIMID, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of REVLIMID therapy.  Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy. Females of reproductive potential should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed. <BR>                        Females of reproductive potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests before initiating REVLIMID.  The first test should be performed within 10-14 days, and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing REVLIMID.  Once treatment has started and during dose interruptions, pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential should occur weekly during the first 4 weeks of use, then pregnancy testing should be repeated every 4 weeks in females with regular menstrual cycles.  If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing should occur every 2 weeks.  Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrual bleeding.  REVLIMID treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation.<BR>                        <BR>                           Males<BR>                           <BR>Lenalidomide is present in the semen of males who take REVLIMID. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking REVLIMID, during dose interruptions and for up to 28 days after discontinuing REVLIMID, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy.  Male patients taking REVLIMID must not donate sperm<BR>								<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.7	Renal Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        Since lenalidomide is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, adjustments to the starting dose of REVLIMID are recommended to provide appropriate drug exposure in patients with moderate (CLcr 30-60 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) and in patients on dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.8	Hepatic Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        No study has been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.
