Co-morbidities occurring with ADHD may be associated with an increase in the risk of suicidal ideation and/or behavior. Patients<BR>who are started on therapy should be monitored closely for suicidality (suicidal<BR>thinking and behavior), clinical worsening, or unusual changes in behavior.<BR>Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation<BR>and communication with the prescriber. STRATTERA is approved for ADHD in pediatric and adult patients. STRATTERA is<BR>not approved for major depressive disorder.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Pooled analyses<BR>of short–term (6 to 18 weeks) placebo–controlled trials of STRATTERA in<BR>children and adolescents (a total of 12 trials involving over 2200 patients,<BR>including 11 trials in ADHD and 1 trial in enuresis) have revealed a greater<BR>risk of suicidal ideation early during treatment in those receiving STRATTERA compared<BR>to placebo.
