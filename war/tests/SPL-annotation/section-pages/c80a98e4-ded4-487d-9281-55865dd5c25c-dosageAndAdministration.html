If full control is not achieved <BR>within the range of 50-300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be <BR>reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive <BR>patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin <BR>lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. <BR>Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high <BR>acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may <BR>require an adjustment in dosage. <BR>                  A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting <BR>many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage <BR>reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage <BR>elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Leprosy: In order to reduce secondary <BR>Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at <BR>Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with <BR>one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be <BR>maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with <BR>corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have <BR>sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet <BR>completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, <BR>the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using <BR>other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. <BR>                  In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the <BR>recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months <BR>of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg <BR>Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of <BR>clinical activity are controlled - usually after an additional six months. Then <BR>Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and <BR>indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients. <BR><BR>                  In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the <BR>co-administration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg <BR>daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if <BR>supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy <BR>drug, usually either Clofazamine 50-100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250-500 mg <BR>daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3-10 years until all signs of clinical <BR>activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. <BR>Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline <BR>patients and for life for lepromatous patients. <BR>                  Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or <BR>borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically <BR>and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken <BR>from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and <BR>supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the <BR>past 3-6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered <BR>confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad <BR>method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge <BR>from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be <BR>treated with other drugs. <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any <BR>effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be <BR>classified into two groups. The “Reversal” reaction (Type 1) may occur in <BR>borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is <BR>started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic <BR>load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response <BR>to residual infection leading to swelling (“Reversal”) of existing skin and <BR>nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids <BR>should always be used. If severe, the patient <BR>should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and <BR>therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or <BR>surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be <BR>contacted for advice in management. <BR>                  Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) <BR>occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. <BR>Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the first year. The <BR>principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules <BR>sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint <BR>swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular <BR>and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense <BR>polymorphonuclear infiltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are <BR>considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be <BR>hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, <BR>steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to <BR>suppress the reaction. <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
