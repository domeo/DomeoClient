A total of 519 patients were randomized to receive either SPRYCEL 100 mg once daily or imatinib 400 mg once daily.  The primary endpoint was the rate of confirmed complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) within 12 months. Confirmed CCyR was defined as a CCyR noted on two consecutive occasions (at least 28 days apart).<BR>                        Median age was 46 years in the SPRYCEL group and 49 years in the imatinib groups, with 10% and 11% of patients ≥65 years of age. There were slightly more male than female patients in both groups (59% vs 41%). Fifty-three percent of all patients were Caucasian, and 39% were Asian. At baseline, the distribution of Hasford Scores was similar in the SPRYCEL and imatinib treatment groups (low risk: 33% and 34%; intermediate risk: 48% and 47%; high risk: 19% and 19%, respectively).<BR>                        The median duration of treatment was 14 months for SPRYCEL and 14 months for imatinib. With a minimum of 12 months follow-up, 85% of patients randomized to SPRYCEL and 81% of patients randomized to imatinib were still on study.<BR>                        Efficacy results are summarized in Table 6.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width="100%" ID="i1832fb8c-bb8a-4044-8cfc-3474e2de592e"><BR>                           <caption>Table 6: Efficacy Results in Newly Diagnosed Patients with Chronic Phase CML</caption><BR>                           <colgroup><BR>                              <col width="40%"/><BR>                              <col width="22%"/><BR>                              <col width="22%"/><BR>                              <col width="16%"/><BR>                           </colgroup><BR>                           <thead><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Toprule">&#160;</th><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Toprule Botrule" align="center" valign="bottom">SPRYCEL<br/>(n=259)</th><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Toprule Botrule" align="center" valign="bottom">Imatinib<br/>(n=260)</th><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Toprule Botrule" align="center" valign="top">p-value</th><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Botrule">&#160;</th><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Botrule" colspan="2">Response rate (95% CI)</th><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Botrule">&#160;</th><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </thead><BR>                           <tfoot><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td colspan="4" rowspan="1" align="left"><BR>                                    <sup>a</sup> Confirmed CCyR is defined as a CCyR noted on two consecutive occasions at least 28 days apart.</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td colspan="4" rowspan="1" align="left"><BR>                                    <sup>b</sup> Major molecular response (at any time) was defined as BCR-ABL ratios &#8804;0.1% by RQ-PCR in peripheral blood samples standardized on the International scale.</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td colspan="4" rowspan="1" align="left"><BR>												*Adjusted for Hasford Score and indicated statistical significance at a pre-defined nominal level of significance.</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td colspan="4" rowspan="1" align="left"><BR>												CI = confidence interval.</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tfoot><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Confirmed CCyR within 12 months</content><BR>                                    <sup>a</sup><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center">76.8% (71.2&#8211;81.8)</td><BR>                                 <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center">66.2% (60.1&#8211;71.9)</td><BR>                                 <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center">p=0.007*</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Major Molecular Response</content><BR>                                    <sup>b</sup><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center">52.1% (45.9&#8211;58.3)</td><BR>                                 <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center">33.8% (28.1&#8211;39.9)</td><BR>                                 <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center">p&lt;0.0001*</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR>Median time to confirmed CCyR was 3.1 months in 199 SPRYCEL responders and 5.6 months in 177 imatinib responders.

In a clinical study in chronic phase CML, resistance to imatinib was defined as failure to achieve a complete hematologic response (CHR; after 3 months), major cytogenetic response (MCyR; after 6 months), or complete cytogenetic response (CCyR; after 12 months); or loss of a previous molecular response (with concurrent ≥10% increase in Ph+ metaphases), cytogenetic response, or hematologic response. Imatinib intolerance was defined as inability to tolerate 400 mg or more of imatinib per day or discontinuation of imatinib because of toxicity. <BR>						<BR>                        Results described below are based on a minimum of 2 years follow-up after the start of SPRYCEL therapy in patients with a median time from initial diagnosis of approximately 5 years. Across all studies, 48% of patients were women, 81% were white, 15% were black or Asian, 25% were 65 years of age or older, and 5% were 75 years of age or older. Most patients had long disease histories with extensive prior treatment, including imatinib, cytotoxic chemotherapy, interferon, and stem cell transplant. Overall, 80% of patients had imatinib-resistant disease and 20% of patients were intolerant to imatinib. The maximum imatinib dose had been 400–600 mg/day in about 60% of the patients and >600 mg/day in 40% of the patients. <BR>						<BR>                        The primary efficacy endpoint in chronic phase CML was MCyR, defined as elimination (CCyR) or substantial diminution (by at least 65%, partial cytogenetic response) of Ph+ hematopoietic cells. The primary efficacy endpoint in accelerated phase, myeloid blast phase, lymphoid blast phase CML, and Ph+ ALL was major hematologic response (MaHR), defined as either a CHR or no evidence of leukemia (NEL). <BR>						<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Chronic Phase CML<BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Dose-Optimization Study: A randomized, open-label study was conducted in patients with chronic phase CML to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SPRYCEL administered once daily compared with SPRYCEL administered twice daily. Patients with significant cardiac diseases, including myocardial infarction within 6 months, congestive heart failure within 3 months, significant arrhythmias, or QTc prolongation were excluded from the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was MCyR in patients with imatinib-resistant CML. A total of 670 patients, of whom 497 had imatinib-resistant disease, were randomized to the SPRYCEL 100 mg once daily, 140 mg once daily, 50 mg twice daily, or 70 mg twice daily group. Median duration of treatment was 22 months. <BR>									<BR>                              Efficacy was achieved across all SPRYCEL treatment groups with the once daily schedule demonstrating comparable efficacy (non-inferiority) to the twice daily schedule on the primary efficacy endpoint (difference in MCyR 1.9%; 95% CI [-6.8%–10.6%]). <BR>								<BR>                              Efficacy results are presented in Table 7 for patients with chronic phase CML who received the recommended starting dose of 100 mg once daily.
