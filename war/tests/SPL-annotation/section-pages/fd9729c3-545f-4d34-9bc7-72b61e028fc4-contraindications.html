As it is not known whether cross-sensitivity exists among the antipsychotics, pimozide should be used with appropriate caution in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to other antipsychotic drugs.<BR>                     Ventricular arrhythmias have been rarely associated with the use of macrolide antibiotics in patients with prolonged QT intervals, as might be produced by ORAP. Specifically, two sudden deaths have been reported when clarithromycin was added to ongoing pimozide therapy. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that pimozide is metabolized partly by the enzyme system cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4). Macrolide antibiotics are inhibitors of CYP 3A4, and thus could potentially impede pimozide metabolism. For these reasons, ORAP is contraindicated in patients receiving the macrolide antibiotics clarithromycin, erythromycin, azithromycin, dirithromycin, and troleandomycin.<BR>                     Concomitant use in patients taking Celexa or Lexapro is contraindicated (see <BR>                           Precautions - Drug Interactions - Pimozide and Celexa<BR>                        ).<BR>                     Clinical drug interaction studies have demonstrated that pimozide is also metabolized by CYP 2D6.  Concomitant use of ORAP with paroxetine and other strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors is contraindicated (See <BR>                           PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions<BR>                        ). <BR>                     Concomitant use of pimozide in patients taking sertraline is contraindicated (See <BR>                           PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions<BR>                        ). <BR>                  <BR>                  Because azole antifungal agents are also inhibitors of the CYP 3A4 enzymes and thus may likewise impair pimozide metabolism, ORAP is contraindicated in patients receiving the azole antifungal agents itraconazole and ketoconazole.<BR>                  Similarly, protease inhibitor drugs are also inhibitors of CYP 3A4, and thus ORAP is contraindicated in patients receiving protease inhibitors such as ritonavir, saquinovir, indinavir, and nelfinavir. (See <BR>                        PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions<BR>                     .)<BR>                  Nefazodone is a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4, and its concomitant use with ORAP is also contraindicated.<BR>                  Other drugs that are relatively less potent inhibitors of CYP 3A4 should also be avoided, in view of the risks: e.g. zileuton, fluvoxamine. <BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
