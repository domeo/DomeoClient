Based on the transplacental passage of I-131, administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen to a pregnant woman can cause fetal harm including severe and possibly irreversible neonatal hypothyroidism. Limited data suggest an increased risk of miscarriage up to a year following I-131 treatment. <BR>                        Inform patients who are pregnant or become pregnant after the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen about the potential hazard to a fetus. Evaluate infants born to mothers treated with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen for hypothyroidism at the time of delivery and during the neonatal period.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        Because immunoglobulins are secreted in human milk, it is expected that tositumomab would be present in human milk. Radiolabeled iodine is excreted in breast milk and may reach concentrations equal to or greater than maternal plasma concentrations. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen, advise women to discontinue nursing or to consider alternative treatment, taking into account the importance of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4 Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        The safety and effectiveness of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen have not been established in children.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5 Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Clinical studies of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.6 Renal Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        Use of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen has not been studied in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.7 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Contraception: Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and for 12 months after treatment ends to avoid the embryo-fetal effects of the radioisotope and the risk of increased pregnancy loss during that time period. <BR>                        The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen exposes the testes to radiation [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)]. Because of the potential for mutagenesis in male gametes, males of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and for 12 months after treatment ends.<BR>                        <BR>                           Infertility: The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen results in radiation exposure of the ovaries and testes. Based on published studies examining patients treated with I-131, the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen may cause transient ovarian or testicular dysfunction. Radiation effects may persist for up to 12 months following treatment. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
