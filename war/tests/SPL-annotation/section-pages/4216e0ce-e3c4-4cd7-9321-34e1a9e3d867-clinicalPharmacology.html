It diffuses readily into all body fluids (cerebrospinal, pleural, and ascitic fluids), tissues, organs, and excreta (saliva, sputum, and feces). The drug also passes through the placental barrier and into milk in concentrations comparable to those in the plasma. From 50 to 70 percent of a dose of isoniazid is excreted in the urine within 24 hours.<BR>Isoniazid is metabolized primarily by acetylation and dehydrazination. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined. Approximately 50 percent of Blacks and Caucasians are "slow inacti- vators", and the rest are "rapid inactivators"; the majority of Eskimos and Orientals are" rapid inactivators."<BR>The rate of acetylation does not significantly alter the effectiveness of isoniazid. However, slow acetylation may lead to higher blood levels of the drug and, thus, to an increase in toxic reactions.<BR>Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency is sometimes observed in adults with high doses of isoniazid and is considered probably due to its competition with pyridoxal phosphate for the enzyme apotryptophanase.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Mechanism of Action<BR><BR>                  Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacteri-<BR>al cell wall. At therapeutic levels isoniazid is bacteriocidal against actively growing intra-<BR>cellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms.<BR><BR>                  Isoniazid resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli develop rapidly when isoniazid monotherapy is administered.<BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
