In these studies, patients were treated with 250 mg of Carisoprodol, 350 mg of Carisoprodol, or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days. The mean age was about 41 years old with 54% females and 46% males and 74 % Caucasian, 16 % Black, 9% Asian, and 2% other.<BR>                        There were no deaths and there were no serious adverse reactions in these two trials. In these two studies, 2.7%, 2%, and 5.4%, of patients treated with placebo, 250 mg of Carisoprodol, and 350 mg of Carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to adverse events; and 0.5%, 0.5%, and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, 250 mg of Carisoprodol, and 350 mg of Carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to central nervous system adverse reactions.<BR>                        Table 1 displays adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with Carisoprodol in the two trials described above.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="500"><BR>                           <caption>Table 1.
