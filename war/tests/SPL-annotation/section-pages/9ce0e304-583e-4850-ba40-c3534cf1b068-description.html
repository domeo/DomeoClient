Citalopram HBr is a racemic bicyclic phthalane derivative designated (Â±)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile, HBr with the following structural formula:<BR>                  <BR>                  C20H22BrFN2O M.W. 405.35<BR>                  Citalopram HBr occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder. Citalopram HBr is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol.<BR>                  Each citalopram tablet USP, for oral administration, contains citalopram HBr equivalent to 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg citalopram base. The tablets also contain the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch, and povidone. In addition, the 10 mg contains red iron oxide and yellow iron oxide; and the 20 mg contains FD&C red #40 aluminum lake and FD&C yellow #6 aluminum lake.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     chemical structure for citalopram HBr<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
