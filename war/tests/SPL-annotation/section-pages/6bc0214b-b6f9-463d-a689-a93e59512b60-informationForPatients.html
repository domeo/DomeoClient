Healthcare providers <BR>should instruct patients, their families and their caregivers to read the <BR>Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. <BR>                        Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the <BR>Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have.

Families and caregivers of patients should be <BR>advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day to day basis, since <BR>changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient’s <BR>prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in <BR>onset or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as <BR>these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and <BR>behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in <BR>the medication [see <BR>                                 Box Warning<BR>                               and <BR>                                 Warnings <BR>and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.3 Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic malignant Syndrome (NMS)-Like Reactions<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome <BR>or NMS-like reactions with the concomitant use of fluoxetine and triptans, <BR>tramadol or other serotonergic agents [see <BR>                                 Warnings and <BR>Precautions (5.2)<BR>                               and <BR>                                 Drug Interactions <BR>(7.3)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                        Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms associated with <BR>serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions that may include mental status changes <BR>(e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., <BR>tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations <BR>(e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., <BR>nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can <BR>resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, in which the symptoms may include <BR>hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid <BR>fluctuation of vital signs and mental status changes.

Signs and symptoms of <BR>hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, <BR>confusion, weakness and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. More severe <BR>and/or acute cases have been associated with hallucination, syncope, seizure, <BR>coma, respiratory arrest and death [see <BR>                                 Warnings and <BR>Precautions (5.8)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.7 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        Fluoxetine may impair judgment, thinking or motor skills.
