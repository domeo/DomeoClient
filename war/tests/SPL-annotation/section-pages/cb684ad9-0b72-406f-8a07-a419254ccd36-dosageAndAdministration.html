Patients taking Effient should also take aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg) daily [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effient may be administered with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)].<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>							Initiate treatment with a single 60 mg oral loading dose (2).<BR>						<BR>                           <BR>							Continue at 10 mg once daily with or without food.

Consider lowering the maintenance dose to 5 mg in patients < 60 kg. The effectiveness and safety of the 5 mg dose have not been prospectively studied.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
