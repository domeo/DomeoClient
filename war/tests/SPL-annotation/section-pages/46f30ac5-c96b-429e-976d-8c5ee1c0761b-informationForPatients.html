Patients should be informed that if they develop signs or symptoms of hepatitis or allergic reaction following use of SELZENTRY (rash, skin or eyes look yellow, dark urine, vomiting, abdominal pain), they should stop SELZENTRY and seek medical evaluation immediately. Patients should understand that laboratory tests for liver enzymes and bilirubin will be ordered prior to starting SELZENTRY, at other times during treatment, and if they develop severe rash or signs and symptoms of hepatitis or an allergic reaction on treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), (5.2)].<BR>                  Patients should be informed that SELZENTRY is not a cure for HIV-1 infection and patients may continue to experience illnesses associated with HIV-1 infection, including opportunistic infections.<BR>                  Patients should remain under the care of a physician when using SELZENTRY. <BR>                  Patients should be advised to avoid doing things that can spread HIV-1 infection to others.<BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        Do not share needles or other injection equipment.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, like toothbrushes and razor blades.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Do not have any kind of sex without protection. Always practice safe sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to lower the chance of sexual contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood.<BR>                     <BR>                        Do not breastfeed. We do not know if SELZENTRY can be passed to your baby in your breast milk and whether it could harm your baby. Also, mothers with HIV-1 should not breastfeed because HIV-1 can be passed to the baby in the breast milk.<BR>                  <BR>                  Patients should be advised that it is important to take all their anti‑HIV medicines as prescribed and at the same time(s) each day. SELZENTRY must always be used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Patients should not alter the dose or discontinue therapy without consulting their physician. If a dose is missed, patients should take the next dose of SELZENTRY as soon as possible and then take their next scheduled dose at its regular time. If it is less than 6 hours before their next scheduled dose, they should not take the missed dose and should instead wait and take the next dose at the regular time. <BR>                  Patients should be advised that when their supply of SELZENTRY starts to run low, they should ask their doctor or pharmacist for a refill. <BR>                  Caution should be used when administering SELZENTRY in patients with a history of postural hypotension or on concomitant medication known to lower blood pressure. Patients should be advised that if they experience dizziness while taking SELZENTRY, they should avoid driving or operating machinery.<BR>                  TROFILE® is a registered trademark of Monogram Biosciences, Inc.<BR>                  Manufactured for:<BR><BR>                  <BR>                  ViiV Healthcare<BR>                  Research Triangle Park, NC 27709<BR>                  by:<BR>                  Pfizer Manufacturing Deutschland GmbH<BR>                  Freiburg, Germany<BR>                  ©2013, ViiV Healthcare.
