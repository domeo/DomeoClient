Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Concomitant use of Carisoprodol Tablets and meprobamate, a metabolite of Carisoprodol Tablets, is not recommended [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS <BR>                           <BR>                              (5.1)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors and Inducers<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with Carisoprodol Tablets could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with Carisoprodol Tablets could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed induction effect on CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of Carisoprodol Tablets is unknown.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
