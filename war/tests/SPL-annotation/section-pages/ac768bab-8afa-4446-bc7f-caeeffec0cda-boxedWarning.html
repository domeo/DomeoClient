Anyone considering the use of XENAZINE must balance the risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for control of choreiform movements.  Close observation of patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior should accompany therapy.  Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risk of depression and suicidality and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician. <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Particular caution should be exercised in treating patients with a history of depression or prior suicide attempts or ideation, which are increased in frequency in Huntington's disease.
