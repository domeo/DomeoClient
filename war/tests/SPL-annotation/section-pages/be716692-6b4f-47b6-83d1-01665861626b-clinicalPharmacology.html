Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks.<BR>                  Irinotecan serves as a water-soluble precursor of the lipophilic metabolite SN-38. SN-38 is formed from irinotecan by carboxylesterase-mediated cleavage of the carbamate bond between the camptothecin moiety and the dipiperidino side chain. SN-38 is approximately 1000 times as potent as irinotecan as an inhibitor of topoisomerase I purified from human and rodent tumor cell lines. In vitro cytotoxicity assays show that the potency of SN-38 relative to irinotecan varies from 2- to 2000-fold. However, the plasma area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) values for SN-38 are 2% to 8% of irinotecan and SN-38 is 95% bound to plasma proteins compared to approximately 50% bound to plasma proteins for irinotecan (see<BR>                         Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     ). The precise contribution of SN-38 to the activity of irinotecan hydrochloride injection is thus unknown. Both irinotecan and SN-38 exist in an active lactone form and an inactive hydroxy acid anion form. A pH-dependent equilibrium exists between the two forms such that an acid pH promotes the formation of the lactone, while a more basic pH favors the hydroxy acid anion form.<BR>                  Administration of irinotecan has resulted in antitumor activity in mice bearing cancers of rodent origin and in human carcinoma xenografts of various histological types.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        After intravenous infusion of irinotecan in humans, irinotecan plasma concentrations decline in a multiexponential manner, with a mean terminal elimination half-life of about 6 to 12 hours. The mean terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite SN-38 is about 10 to 20 hours. The half-lives of the lactone (active) forms of irinotecan and SN-38 are similar to those of total irinotecan and SN-38, as the lactone and hydroxy acid forms are in equilibrium.<BR>                        Over the recommended dose range of 50 to 350 mg/m2, the AUC of irinotecan increases linearly with dose; the AUC of SN-38 increases less than proportionally with dose. Maximum concentrations of the active metabolite SN-38 are generally seen within 1 hour following the end of a 90-minute infusion of irinotecan. <BR>                        Pharmacokinetic parameters for irinotecan and SN-38 following a 90-minute infusion of irinotecan at dose levels of 125 and 340 mg/m2 determined in two clinical studies in patients with solid tumors are summarized in Table 1:<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><BR>                           <caption>Table 1.Summary of Mean (&#177;Standard Deviation) Irinotecan and SN-38 Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Patients with Solid Tumors </caption><BR>                           <col width="11%"/><BR>                           <col width="11%"/><BR>                           <col width="11%"/><BR>                           <col width="11%"/><BR>                           <col width="11%"/><BR>                           <col width="11%"/><BR>                           <col width="11%"/><BR>                           <col width="11%"/><BR>                           <col width="12%"/><BR>                           <thead><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <th align="center" rowspan="2" styleCode="     Rrule     "> Dose<br/>(mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" colspan="5" styleCode="     Rrule     "> Irinotecan</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" colspan="3"> SN-38</th><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Rrule     "> C<sub>max</sub><BR>                                    <br/>(ng/mL)</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Rrule     "> AUC<sub>0&#8211;24</sub><BR>                                    <br/>(ng&#8729;h/mL)</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Rrule     "> t<sub>1/2</sub><BR>                                    <br/>(h)</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Rrule     "> V<sub>z</sub><BR>                                    <br/>(L/m<sup>2</sup>) </th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Rrule     "> CL<br/>(L/h/m<sup>2</sup>)</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Rrule     "> C<sub>max</sub><BR>                                    <br/>(ng/mL)</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Rrule     "> AUC<sub>0&#8211;24</sub><BR>                                    <br/>(ng&#8729;h/mL)</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top"> t<sub>1/2</sub><BR>                                    <br/>(h)</th><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </thead><BR>                           <tfoot><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td valign="top" colspan="9">&#160;&#160;C<sub>max</sub> -

In vitro studies indicate that irinotecan, SN-38 and another metabolite aminopentane carboxylic acid (APC), do not inhibit cytochrome P-450 isozymes. SN-38 is subsequently conjugated predominantly by the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) to form a glucuronide metabolite. UGT1A1 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity such as the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism. Approximately 10% of the North American population is homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (also referred to as UGT1A1 7/7 genotype). In a prospective study, in which irinotecan was administered as a single-agent (350 mg/m2) on a once-every-3-week schedule, patients with the UGT1A1 7/7 genotype had a higher exposure to SN-38 than patients with the wild-type UGT1A1 allele (UGT1A1 6/6 genotype) (See <BR>                                    WARNINGS<BR>                                  and <BR>                                    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION<BR>                                 ).

Results from this trial indicate that there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan, SN-38, and SN-38 glucuronide in patients <65 years of age compared with patients ≥65 years of age. In a study of 162 patients that was not prospectively designed to investigate the effect of age, small (less than 18%) but statistically significant differences in dose-normalized irinotecan pharmacokinetic parameters in patients <65 years of age compared to patients ≥65 years of age were observed. Although dose-normalized AUC0–24 for SN-38 in patients ≥65 years of age was 11% higher than in patients <65 years of age, this difference was not statistically significant. No change in the starting dose is recommended for geriatric patients receiving the weekly dosage schedule of irinotecan.

The magnitude of these effects is proportional to the degree of liver impairment as measured by elevations in total bilirubin and transaminase concentrations. However, the tolerability of irinotecan in patients with hepatic dysfunction (bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dL) has not been assessed sufficiently, and no recommendations for dosing can be made.

The appropriate starting dose for patients taking these anticonvulsants has not been formally defined. The following drugs are also CYP3A4 inducers: rifampin, rifabutin. For patients requiring anticonvulsant treatment, consideration should be given to substituting non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsants at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of irinotecan therapy.
