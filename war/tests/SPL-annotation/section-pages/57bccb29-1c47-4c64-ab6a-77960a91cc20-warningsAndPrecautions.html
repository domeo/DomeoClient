In the randomized single-agent NSCLC studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)], the incidence of serious ILD-like events in the TARCEVA treated patients versus placebo treated patients was 0.7% versus 0% in the maintenance study and 0.8% for both groups in the 2nd and 3rd line study. In the pancreatic cancer study - in combination with gemcitabine –  [see Clinical Studies (14.4)],  the incidence of ILD-like events was 2.5% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine group vs. 0.4% in the placebo plus gemcitabine group. <BR>                        The overall incidence of ILD-like events in approximately 32,000 TARCEVA-treated patients from all studies (including uncontrolled studies and studies with concurrent chemotherapy) was approximately 1.1%.  <BR>                        Reported diagnoses in patients suspected of having ILD-like events included pneumonitis, radiation pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and lung infiltration. Symptoms started from 5 days to more than 9 months (median 39 days) after initiating TARCEVA therapy. In the lung cancer trials most of the cases were associated with confounding or contributing factors such as concomitant/prior chemotherapy, prior radiotherapy, pre-existing parenchymal lung disease, metastatic lung disease, or pulmonary infections. <BR>                        In the event of an acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, TARCEVA therapy should be interrupted pending diagnostic evaluation. If ILD is diagnosed, TARCEVA should be discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.2 Renal Failure<BR>                     <BR>                        Cases of hepatorenal syndrome, acute renal failure (including fatalities), and renal insufficiency have been reported. Some were secondary to baseline hepatic impairment while others were associated with severe dehydration due to diarrhea, vomiting, and/or anorexia or concurrent chemotherapy use. In the event of dehydration, particularly in patients with contributing risk factors for renal failure (eg, pre-existing renal disease, medical conditions or medications that may lead to renal disease, or other predisposing conditions including advanced age), TARCEVA therapy should be interrupted and appropriate measures should be taken to intensively rehydrate the patient. Periodic monitoring of renal function and serum electrolytes is recommended in patients at risk of dehydration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.3 Hepatotoxicity <BR>                     <BR>                        Cases of hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome (including fatalities) have been reported during use of TARCEVA, particularly in patients with baseline hepatic impairment. Therefore, periodic liver function testing (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) is recommended. In the setting of worsening liver function tests, dose interruption and/or dose reduction with frequent liver function test monitoring should be considered. TARCEVA dosing should be interrupted or discontinued if total bilirubin is >3 x ULN and/or transaminases are >5 x ULN in the setting of normal pretreatment values [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.4 Patients with Hepatic Impairment <BR>                     <BR>                        In a pharmacokinetic study in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) associated with significant liver tumor burden, 10 out of 15 patients died on treatment or within 30 days of the last TARCEVA dose. One patient died from hepatorenal syndrome, 1 patient died from rapidly progressing liver failure and the remaining 8 patients died from progressive disease. Six out of the 10 patients who died had baseline total bilirubin > 3 x ULN suggesting severe hepatic impairment. Treatment with TARCEVA should be used with extra caution in patients with total bilirubin > 3 x ULN. Patients with hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > ULN or Child-Pugh A, B and C) should be closely monitored during therapy with TARCEVA. TARCEVA dosing should be interrupted or discontinued if changes in liver function are severe such as doubling of total bilirubin and/or tripling of transaminases in the setting of pretreatment values outside normal range [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.5 Gastrointestinal Perforation <BR>                     <BR>                        Gastrointestinal perforation (including fatalities) have been reported in patients receiving TARCEVA. Patients receiving concomitant anti-angiogenic agents, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and/or taxane-based chemotherapy, or who have prior history of peptic ulceration or diverticular disease are at increased risk. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1,6.2)].

Erlotinib administered to rabbits during organogenesis at doses that result in plasma drug concentrations of approximately 3 times those in humans at the recommended dose of 150 mg daily, was associated with embryofetal lethality and abortion. When erlotinib was administered to female rats prior to mating and through the first week of pregnancy, at doses 0.3 or 0.7 times the clinical dose of 150 mg, on a mg/m2 basis, there was an increase in early resorptions that resulted in a decrease in the number of live fetuses [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].<BR>                        <BR>                        There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using TARCEVA. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy while on TARCEVA. Adequate contraceptive methods should be used during therapy, and for at least 2 weeks after completing therapy. If TARCEVA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
