Twenty patients with median predicted FEV1 at baseline of 56% (range: 42% to 109%) received KALYDECO 25, 75, 150 mg or placebo every 12 hours for 14 days and 19 patients with median predicted FEV1 at baseline of 69% (range: 40% to 122%) received KALYDECO 150, 250 mg or placebo every 12 hours for 28 days. The selection of the 150 mg every 12 hours dose was primarily based on nominal improvements in lung function (pre-dose FEV1) and changes in pharmacodynamic parameters (sweat chloride and nasal potential difference). The twice-daily dosing regimen was primarily based on an apparent terminal plasma half-life of approximately 12 hours. Selection of the 150 mg dose of KALYDECO for children 6 to 11 years of age was based on achievement of comparable pharmacokinetics as those observed for adult patients. <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Efficacy:<BR>                              <BR>                              The efficacy of KALYDECO in patients with CF who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 213 clinically stable patients with CF (109 receiving KALYDECO 150 mg twice daily). All eligible patients from these trials were rolled over into an open-label extension study.<BR>                              Trial 1 evaluated 161 patients with CF who were 12 years of age or older (mean age 26 years) with baseline FEV1 between 40-90% predicted [mean FEV1 64% predicted (range: 32% to 98%)]. Trial 2 evaluated 52 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age (mean age 9 years) with baseline FEV1 between 40-105% predicted [mean FEV1 84% predicted (range: 44% to 134%)].

The use of inhaled hypertonic saline was not permitted.<BR>                              The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was improvement in lung function as determined by the mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted pre-dose FEV1 through 24 weeks of treatment.<BR>                              In both studies, treatment with KALYDECO resulted in a significant improvement in FEV1. The treatment difference between KALYDECO and placebo for the mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 10.6 percentage points (P < 0.0001) in Trial 1 and 12.5 percentage points (P < 0.0001) in Trial 2 (Figure 3). These changes persisted through 48 weeks. Improvements in percent predicted FEV1 were observed regardless of age, disease severity, sex, and geographic region.<BR>                              <BR>                                 Figure 3: Mean Absolute Change from Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV1 *<BR>                              <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                              *primary endpoint was assessed at the 24-week time point.<BR>                              Other efficacy variables included absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline to week 24 [discussed in <BR>                                    Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], time to first pulmonary exacerbation through week 48 (Trial 1 only), absolute change in weight from baseline to week 48, and improvement in cystic fibrosis symptoms including relevant respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum production, and difficulty breathing. For the purpose of the study, a pulmonary exacerbation was defined as a change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral) as a result of 4 or more of 12 pre-specified sino-pulmonary signs/symptoms. Patients treated with KALYDECO demonstrated statistically significant improvements in risk of pulmonary exacerbations, CF symptoms (in Trial 1 only), and gain in body weight (Table 2). Weight data, when expressed as body mass index normalized for age and sex in patients <20 years of age, was consistent with absolute change from baseline in weight. <BR>                              <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="100%" ID="table2"><BR>                                 <caption>Table 2:  Effect of KALYDECO on Other Efficacy Endpoints in Trials 1 and 2</caption><BR>                                 <col width="30%" align="left" valign="bottom"/><BR>                                 <col width="27%" align="center" valign="bottom"/><BR>                                 <col width="8%" align="center" valign="bottom"/><BR>                                 <col width="27%" align="center" valign="bottom"/><BR>                                 <col width="8%" align="center" valign="bottom"/><BR>                                 <thead><BR>                                    <tr><BR>                                       <th/><BR>                                       <th colspan="2" styleCode="Botrule">Trial 1</th><BR>                                       <th colspan="2" styleCode="Botrule">Trial 2</th><BR>                                    </tr><BR>                                    <tr><BR>                                       <th>Endpoint</th><BR>                                       <th>Treatment difference<footnote ID="foot2a">Treatment difference = effect of KALYDECO &#8722;

Patients were randomized 4:1 to receive KALYDECO 150 mg (n=112) every twelve hours or placebo (n=28) in addition to their prescribed CF therapies.

Treatment with KALYDECO resulted in no improvement in FEV1 relative to placebo in patients with CF homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene [mean absolute change from baseline through Week 16 in percent predicted FEV1 was 1.5% and -0.2% for patients in the KALYDECO and placebo-treated groups, respectively (p = 0.15)]. There were no meaningful differences between patients treated with KALYDECO compared to placebo for secondary endpoints (change in CF symptoms, change in weight, or change in sweat chloride concentration).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
