During its premarketing assessment, multiple doses of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were also administered to 3514 patients in other Phase 3 studies. In addition, in premarketing assessment of venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets, multiple doses were administered to 2897 patients in Phase 2 to Phase 3 studies for major depressive disorder. The conditions and duration of exposure to venlafaxine in both development programs varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient (venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets only) and outpatient studies, fixed-dose, and titration studies. Adverse reactions associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized reaction categories.<BR>                        In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse reactions were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 7212 patients exposed to multiple doses of either formulation of venlafaxine who experienced a reaction of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving venlafaxine. All reported reactions are included except those already listed in Tables 6 and 7 and those reactions for which a drug cause was remote. If the COSTART term for a reaction was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions reported occurred during treatment with venlafaxine, they were not necessarily caused by it.<BR>                        Reactions are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are defined as those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.<BR>                        Body as a whole - Frequent: chest pain substernal, chills, fever, neck pain;
