The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for FANAPT consisting of 2070 patients exposed to FANAPT at doses of 10 mg/day or greater, for the treatment of schizophrenia.  All of these patients who received FANAPT were participating in multiple-dose clinical trials.  The conditions and duration of treatment with FANAPT varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories), open-label and double-blind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixed-dose and flexible-dose studies, and short-term and longer-term exposure.<BR>                        Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using their own terminology.  Consequently, to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions, reactions were grouped in standardized categories using MedDRA terminology.<BR>                        The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportions of individuals who experienced a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed.  A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.<BR>                        The information presented in these sections was derived from pooled data from four placebo-controlled, 4- or 6-week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies in patients who received FANAPT at daily doses within a range of 10 to 24 mg (n=874).<BR>                        <BR>                           Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More among FANAPT-Treated Patients and More Frequent than Placebo<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Table 1 enumerates the pooled incidences of treatment-emergent adverse reactions that were spontaneously reported in four placebo-controlled, 4- or 6-week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies, listing those reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with FANAPT in any of the dose groups, and for which the incidence in FANAPT-treated patients in any dose group was greater than the incidence in patients treated with placebo.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="750" ID="T1"><BR>                           <caption>Table 1:	Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Fixed- or Flexible-Dose, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adult Patients*</caption><BR>                           <tfoot><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td colspan="4">*Table includes adverse reactions that were reported in 2% or more of patients in any of the FANAPT dose groups and which occurred at greater incidence than in the placebo group.

Similarly, there were no medically important changes in triglyceride and total cholesterol measurements (Table 3).  There were no differences between FANAPT and placebo in the incidence of discontinuation due to changes in hematology, urinalysis, or serum chemistry.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="650" ID="T3"><BR>                           <caption>Table 3:	Change in Lipids Compared to Placebo</caption><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Mean change from<br/>baseline (mg/dL)</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Placebo</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">FANAPT 10-16 mg/day</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">FANAPT 20-24 mg/day</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr styleCode="Botrule"><BR>                                 <td/><BR>                                 <td align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">(N=587)</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">(N=483)</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">(N=391)</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td>Triglycerides</td><BR>                                 <td align="center">-26.5</td><BR>                                 <td align="center">-26.5</td><BR>                                 <td align="center">-8.8</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td>Total Cholesterol</td><BR>                                 <td align="center">-7.7</td><BR>                                 <td align="center">-3.9</td><BR>                                 <td align="center">3.9</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR>In short-term placebo-controlled trials (4- to 6-weeks), there were 1.0% (13/1342) iloperidone-treated patients with hematocrit at least one time below the extended normal range during post-randomization treatment, compared to 0.3% (2/585) on placebo.
