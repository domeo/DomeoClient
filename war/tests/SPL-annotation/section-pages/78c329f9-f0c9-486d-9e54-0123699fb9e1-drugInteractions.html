In vitro studies have shown antagonism between these two antimicrobials. The clinical significance of this in vitro antagonism is not known.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.3 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents<BR>                     <BR>                        Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents.
