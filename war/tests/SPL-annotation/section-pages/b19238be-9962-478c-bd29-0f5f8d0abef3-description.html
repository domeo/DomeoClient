The structural formula is:<BR>                  <BR>                  C16H14F2N3NaO4Sâ€¢1.5 H2O      M.W. 432.4<BR>                  Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is a white to off-white crystalline powder and is racemic. Pantoprazole has weakly basic and acidic properties. Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is freely soluble in water, very slightly soluble in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, and practically insoluble in n-hexane.<BR>                  The stability of the compound in aqueous solution is pH-dependent. The rate of degradation increases with decreasing pH. At ambient temperature, the degradation half-life is approximately 2.8 hours at pH 5 and approximately 220 hours at pH 7.8.<BR>                  Pantoprazole sodium USP is supplied as a delayed-release tablet, available in two strengths (20 mg and 40 mg). <BR>                  Each pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablet USP contains 45.1 mg or 22.6 mg of pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (equivalent to 40 mg or 20 mg pantoprazole, respectively) with the following inactive ingredients: calcium carbonate, calcium stearate, D&C yellow #10 aluminum lake, FD&C yellow #6 aluminum lake, hypromellose, iron oxide black, iron oxide yellow, lactose monohydrate, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, methacrylic acid copolymer, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, shellac glaze, sodium carbonate anhydrous, stearic acid, talc, titanium dioxide, and triethyl citrate.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     pantoprazole sodium structural formula<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
