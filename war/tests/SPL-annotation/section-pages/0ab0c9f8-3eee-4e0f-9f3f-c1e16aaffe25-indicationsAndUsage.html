KALYDECO is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age 6 years and older who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene. If the patient's genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect the presence of the G551D mutation.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        KALYDECO is classified as a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator.
