Severity of the disease was classified based on the Los Angeles Classification Grading System (Grades A-D). Patients were randomized to one of the following three treatment groups: KAPIDEX 60 mg daily, KAPIDEX 90 mg daily or lansoprazole 30 mg daily. Patients who were H pylori positive or who had Barrett's Esophagus and/or definite dysplastic changes at baseline were excluded from these studies. A total of 4092 patients were enrolled and ranged in age from 18 to 90 years (median age 48 years) with 54% male.  Race was distributed as follows: 87% Caucasian, 5% Black and 8% other.  Based on the Los Angeles Classification, 71% of patients had mild EE (Grades A and B) and 29% of patients had moderate to severe EE (Grades C and D) before treatment.<BR>                        The studies were designed to test non-inferiority.  If non-inferiority was demonstrated then superiority would be tested.  Although non-inferiority was demonstrated in both studies, the finding of superiority in one study was not replicated in the other.<BR>                        The proportion of patients with healed EE at week 4 or 8 is presented below in Table 5.  <BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="100%" ID="table5"><BR>                           <caption>Table 5: EE Healing Rates<footnote>Based on crude rate estimates, patients who did not have endoscopically documented healed EE and prematurely discontinued were considered not healed.</footnote>: All Grades</caption><BR>                           <col width="8%" align="center" valign="middle"/><BR>                           <col width="15%" align="center" valign="middle"/><BR>                           <col width="25%" align="center" valign="middle"/><BR>                           <col width="15%" align="center" valign="middle"/><BR>                           <col width="15%" align="center" valign="middle"/><BR>                           <col width="22%" align="center" valign="middle"/><BR>                           <thead><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Rrule" valign="bottom">Study</th><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Rrule" valign="bottom">Number of Patients<br/>(N)<footnote>Patients with at least one post baseline endoscopy</footnote><BR>                                 </th><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Rrule" valign="bottom">Treatment Group<br/>(daily)</th><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Rrule" valign="bottom">Week 4<br/>% Healed</th><BR>                                 <th valign="bottom" styleCode="Rrule">Week 8<footnote>Primary efficacy endpoint</footnote><BR>                                    <br/>% Healed</th><BR>                                 <th>(95% CI) for the Treatment Difference (KAPIDEX &#8211;
