Drug interactions that reduce the metabolism of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone would increase the plasma concentrations of risperidone and lower the concentrations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Analysis of clinical studies involving a modest number of poor metabolizers (n70) does not suggest that poor and extensive metabolizers have different rates of adverse effects. No comparison of effectiveness in the two groups has been made. <BR>                           <BR><BR>                           <BR>In vitro studies showed that drugs metabolized by other CYP isozymes, including 1A1, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4, are only weak inhibitors of risperidone metabolism.<BR> <BR>Fluoxetine and Paroxetine<BR> <BR>Fluoxetine (20 mg once daily) and paroxetine (20 mg once daily) have been shown to increase the plasma concentration of risperidone 2.5 to 2.8 fold and 3 to 9 fold, respectively. Fluoxetine did not affect the plasma concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Paroxetine lowered the concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone by about 10%. When either concomitant fluoxetine or paroxetine is initiated or discontinued, the physician should re-evaluate the dosing of risperidone. The effects of discontinuation of concomitant fluoxetine or paroxetine therapy on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone have not been studied.<BR> <BR>Erythromycin<BR> <BR>There were no significant interactions between risperidone and erythromycin.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Symbol-1<BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.11 Carbamazepine and Other Enzyme Inducers<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>Carbamazepine coadministration decreased the steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone by about 50%. Plasma concentrations of carbamazepine did not appear to be affected. The dose of risperidone may need to be titrated accordingly for patients receiving carbamazepine, particularly during initiation or discontinuation of carbamazepine therapy. Coadministration of other known enzyme inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital) with risperidone may cause similar decreases in the combined plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone, which could lead to decreased efficacy of risperidone treatment.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.12 Drugs Metabolized by CYP 2D6<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR><BR>                        In vitro studies indicate that risperidone is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP 2D6. Therefore, risperidone is not expected to substantially inhibit the clearance of drugs that are metabolized by this enzymatic pathway. In drug interaction studies, risperidone did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of donepezil and galantamine, which are metabolized by CYP 2D6. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
