Patients should be advised to avoid taking carisoprodol before engaging in potentially hazardous activities such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery (see <BR>                                 WARNINGS, Sedation<BR>                              ).<BR>											<BR>                           Patients should be advised to avoid alcoholic beverages while taking carisoprodol and to check with their doctor before taking other CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, sedating antihistamines, or other sedatives (see <BR>                                 WARNINGS, Sedation<BR>                              ).<BR>											<BR>                           Patients should be advised that treatment with carisoprodol should be limited to acute use (up to two or three weeks) for the relief of acute, musculoskeletal discomfort. In the postmarketing experience with carisoprodol, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. If the musculoskeletal symptoms still persist, patients should contact their healthcare provider for further evaluation.<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Aspirin:<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Patients should be warned that aspirin can cause epigastric discomfort, gastric and duodenal ulcers, and serious GI adverse reactions, such as bleeding, perforation, and/or obstruction of the stomach or intestines, which may result in hospitalization and death. Although serious GI bleeding can occur without warning symptoms (e.g., hematemesis, melena, hematochezia), patients should be alert for these symptoms and should seek urgent medical care if any of these indicative symptoms occur (see <BR>                                 WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions<BR>                              ). In addition, patients should be alert for symptoms of ulcers (e.g., night time epigastric discomfort, vomiting, weight loss) and should seek medical attention if these symptoms occur. Patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day should be counseled about the GI bleeding risks involved with the use of aspirin with alcohol.<BR>                           Patients should be informed of the symptoms of an anaphylactoid reaction or anaphylaxis (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face or throat). If these symptoms occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help.<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
