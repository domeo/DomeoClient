Narcotics also produce other CNS depressant effects, such as drowsiness, that may further obscure the clinical course of the patients with head injuries.Codeine or other narcotics may obscure signs on which to judge the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.Codeine is habit-forming and potentially abusable. Consequently, the extended use of this product is not recommended.<BR><BR><BR></P></DIV></HTML>
