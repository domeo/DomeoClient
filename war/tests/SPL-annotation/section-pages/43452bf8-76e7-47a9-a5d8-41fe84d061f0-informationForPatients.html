Signs and symptoms of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.3     Metabolic Changes<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be aware of the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus.  Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes, those with risk factors for diabetes, or those who develop these symptoms during treatment should have their blood glucose monitored at the beginning of and periodically during treatment.  Patients should be counseled that weight gain has occurred during treatment with FANAPT. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.
