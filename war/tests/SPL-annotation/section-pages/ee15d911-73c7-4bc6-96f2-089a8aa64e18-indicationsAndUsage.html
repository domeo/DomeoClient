Evidence supporting efficacy of carbamazepine as an anticonvulsant was derived from active drug-controlled studies that enrolled patients with the following seizure types:<BR>                        <BR>                           Partial seizures with complex symptomatology (psychomotor, temporal lobe). Patients with these seizures appear to show greater improvements than those with other types.<BR>                           Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal).<BR>                           Mixed seizure patterns which include the above, or other partial or generalized seizures. Absence seizures (petit mal) do not appear to be controlled by carbamazepine (see PRECAUTIONS, General).<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Trigeminal Neuralgia<BR>                     <BR>                        Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules are indicated in the treatment of the pain associated with true trigeminal neuralgia.<BR>                        Beneficial results have also been reported in glossopharyngeal neuralgia.
