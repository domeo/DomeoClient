There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of XALKORI in pregnant women. In nonclinical studies in rats, crizotinib was embryotoxic and fetotoxic at exposures similar to and above those observed in humans at the recommended clinical dose of 250 mg twice daily. Crizotinib was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis to study the effects on embryo-fetal development. Postimplantation loss was increased at doses ≥ 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.2 times the AUC at the recommended human dose) in rats. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats at doses up to the maternally toxic dose of 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the AUC at the recommended human dose) or in rabbits at doses of up to 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the AUC at the recommended human dose), though fetal body weights were reduced at these doses.<BR>                              Advise women of childbearing potential to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving XALKORI. Women of childbearing potential who are receiving this drug, or partners of women of childbearing potential receiving this drug, should use adequate contraceptive methods during therapy and for at least 90 days after completing therapy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient or their partner becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        It is not known whether XALKORI is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from XALKORI, consider whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4 Pediatric Use <BR>                     <BR>                        The safety and efficacy of XALKORI in pediatric patients has not been established. Decreased bone formation in growing long bones was observed in immature rats at 150 mg/kg/day following once daily dosing for 28 days (approximately 10 times the AUC in adult patients at the recommended human dose). Other toxicities of potential concern to pediatric patients have not been evaluated in juvenile animals.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5 Geriatric Use <BR>                     <BR>                        Clinical studies of XALKORI did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Of the 136 patients in Study A, 19 (14%) were 65 years or older. Of the 119 patients in Study B, 16 (13%) were 65 years or older. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.6 Hepatic Impairment <BR>                     <BR>                        XALKORI has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. As crizotinib is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment is likely to increase plasma crizotinib concentrations. Clinical studies excluded patients with AST or ALT greater than 2.5 × ULN, or greater than 5 × ULN, if due to liver metastases. Patients with total bilirubin greater than 1.5 × ULN were also excluded. Therefore, use caution in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.7 Renal Impairment <BR>                     <BR>                        No starting dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 60 to 90 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 60 mL/min), as steady-state trough concentrations in these two groups were similar to those in patients with normal renal function (CLcr greater than 90 mL/min) in Study B. The potential need for starting dose adjustment in patients with severe renal impairment cannot be determined, as clinical and pharmacokinetic data were available for only one patient. In addition, no data are available for patients with end-stage renal disease. Therefore, use caution in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 mL/min) or patients with end-stage renal disease  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
