Limb abnormalities were seen in the offspring of monkeys that were dosed with lenalidomide during organogenesis.   This effect was seen at all doses tested.  Due to the results of this developmental monkey study, and lenalidomideâ€™s structural similarities to thalidomide, a known human teratogen, lenalidomide is contraindicated in females who are pregnant [see Boxed Warning].  If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
