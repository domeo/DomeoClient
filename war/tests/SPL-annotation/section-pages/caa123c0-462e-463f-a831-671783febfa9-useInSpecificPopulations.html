The incidence of malformations was not increased compared to control in offspring of rats or rabbits given 0.4 to 6 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In three reproductive studies in rats (two Segment III and a multigenerational study), there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation at doses of 0.16 to 5 mg/kg or 0.1 to 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. It is not known whether these deaths were due to a direct effect on the fetuses or pups or to effects on the dams.<BR> <BR>There was no no-effect dose for increased rat pup mortality. In one Segment III study, there was an increase in stillborn rat pups at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg or 1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In a cross-fostering study in Wistar rats, toxic effects on the fetus or pups, as evidenced by a decrease in the number of live pups and an increase in the number of dead pups at birth (Day 0), and a decrease in birth weight in pups of drug-treated dams were observed. In addition, there was an increase in deaths by Day 1 among pups of drug-treated dams, regardless of whether or not the pups were cross-fostered. Risperidone also appeared to impair maternal behavior in that pup body weight gain and survival (from Day 1 to 4 of lactation) were reduced in pups born to control but reared by drug-treated dams. These effects were all noted at the one dose of risperidone tested, i.e., 5 mg/kg or 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis.<BR> <BR>Placental transfer of risperidone occurs in rat pups. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, there was one report of a case of agenesis of the corpus callosum in an infant exposed to risperidone in utero. The causal relationship to risperidone therapy is unknown. Reversible extrapyramidal symptoms in the neonate were observed following postmarketing use of Risperidone during the last trimester of pregnancy.<BR> <BR>Risperidone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.2 Labor and Delivery<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>The effect of risperidone on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>In animal studies, risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone are excreted in milk.

Additional safety information was also assessed in a long-term study in patients with autistic disorder, or in short- and long-term studies in more than 1200 pediatric patients with psychiatric disorders other than autistic disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar mania who were of similar age and weight, and who received similar dosages of risperidone as patients treated for irritability associated with autistic disorder.<BR><BR>                        <BR>The safety and effectiveness of risperidone in pediatric patients less than 5 years of age with autistic disorder have not been established.<BR> <BR><BR>                        Due to Janssen Pharmaceuticals Corporation’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled for use in pediatric patients with schizophrenia or bipolar mania. Information on clinical trials and risperidone use for pediatric patients with schizophrenia, 13 to 17 years of age and the bipolar mania, 10 to 17 years of age is approved for Janssen Pharmaceuticals Corporation’s risperidone drug products.<BR>                        <BR> <BR>Tardive Dyskinesia<BR> <BR>In clinical trials in 1885 children and adolescents treated with risperidone, 2 (0.1%) patients were reported to have tardive dyskinesia, which resolved on discontinuation of risperidone treatment [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].<BR> <BR>Weight Gain<BR> <BR>In a long-term, open-label extension study in adolescent patients with schizophrenia, weight increase was reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 14% of patients. In 103 adolescent patients with schizophrenia, a mean increase of 9 kg was observed after 8 months of risperidone treatment. The majority of that increase was observed within the first 6 months. The average percentiles at baseline and 8 months, respectively, were 56 and 72 for weight, 55 and 58 for height, and 51 and 71 for body mass index.<BR> <BR>In long-term, open-label trials (studies in patients with autistic disorder or other psychiatric disorders), a mean increase of 7.5 kg after 12 months of risperidone treatment was observed, which was higher than the expected normal weight gain (approximately 3 to 3.5 kg per year adjusted for age, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention normative data). The majority of that increase occurred within the first 6 months of exposure to risperidone. The average percentiles at baseline and 12 months, respectively, were 49 and 60 for weight, 48 and 53 for height, and 50 and 62 for body mass index.<BR> <BR>In one 3-week, placebo-controlled trial in children and adolescent patients with acute manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder, increases in body weight were higher in the risperidone groups than the placebo group, but not dose related (1.9 kg in the risperidone 0.5 to 2.5 mg group, 1.44 kg in the risperidone 3 to 6 mg group, and 0.65 kg in the placebo group). A similar trend was observed in the mean change from baseline in body mass index.<BR> <BR>When treating pediatric patients with risperidone for any indication, weight gain should be assessed against that expected with normal growth. [See also Adverse Reactions (6.7)] <BR> <BR>Somnolence<BR> <BR>Somnolence was frequently observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials of pediatric patients with autistic disorder. Most cases were mild or moderate in severity. These events were most often of early onset with peak incidence occurring during the first two weeks of treatment, and transient with a median duration of 16 days. Somnolence was the most commonly observed adverse event in the clinical trial of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents, as well as in the schizophrenia trials in adolescents. As was seen in the autistic disorder trials, these events were most often of early onset and transient in duration. [See also Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3)] Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from a change in dosing regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)].<BR> <BR>Hyperprolactinemia, Growth, and Sexual Maturation<BR> <BR>Risperidone has been shown to elevate prolactin levels in children and adolescents as well as in adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of up to 8 weeks duration in children and adolescents (aged 5 to 17 years) with autistic disorder or psychiatric disorders other than autistic disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar mania, 49% of patients who received risperidone had elevated prolactin levels compared to 2% of patients who received placebo. Similarly, in placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents (aged 10 to 17 years) with bipolar disorder, or adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia, 82 to 87% of patients who received risperidone had elevated levels of prolactin compared to 3 to 7% of patients on placebo. Increases were dose-dependent and generally greater in females than in males across indications.<BR> <BR>In clinical trials in 1885 children and adolescents, galactorrhea was reported in 0.8% of risperidone-treated patients and gynecomastia was reported in 2.3% of risperidone-treated patients.<BR> <BR>The long-term effects of risperidone on growth and sexual maturation have not been fully evaluated.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5 Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>Clinical studies of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether or not they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, a lower starting dose is recommended for an elderly patient, reflecting a decreased pharmacokinetic clearance in the elderly, as well as a greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)]. While elderly patients exhibit a greater tendency to orthostatic hypotension, its risk in the elderly may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 0.5 mg twice daily followed by careful titration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients for whom this is of concern. <BR> <BR>This drug is substantially excreted by the kidneys, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. <BR> <BR>Concomitant use with Furosemide in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis<BR> <BR>In two of four placebo-controlled trials in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, a higher incidence of mortality was observed in patients treated with furosemide plus risperidone when compared to patients treated with risperidone alone or with placebo plus furosemide. No pathological mechanism has been identified to explain this finding, and no consistent pattern for cause of death was observed. An increase of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis was seen with the use of risperidone regardless of concomitant use with furosemide. Risperidone is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.
