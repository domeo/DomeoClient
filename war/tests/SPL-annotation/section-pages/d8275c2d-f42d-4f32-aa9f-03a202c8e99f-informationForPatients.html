ABILIFY is not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Clinical Worsening of Depression and Suicide Risk<BR>                        <BR>                        Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient’s prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].<BR>                        Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with ABILIFY and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide including information about “Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions” is available for ABILIFY. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. It should be noted that ABILIFY is not approved as a single agent for treatment of depression and has not been evaluated in pediatric major depressive disorder.<BR>                        <BR>                           Use of Orally Disintegrating Tablet<BR>                        <BR>                        Do not open the blister until ready to administer. For single tablet removal, open the package and peel back the foil on the blister to expose the tablet. Do not push the tablet through the foil because this could damage the tablet. Immediately upon opening the blister, using dry hands, remove the tablet and place the entire ABILIFY DISCMELT Orally Disintegrating Tablet on the tongue. Tablet disintegration occurs rapidly in saliva. It is recommended that ABILIFY DISCMELT be taken without liquid. However, if needed, it can be taken with liquid. Do not attempt to split the tablet.<BR>                        <BR>                           Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance <BR>                        <BR>                        Because aripiprazole may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole therapy does not affect them adversely [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Pregnancy<BR>                        <BR>                        Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with ABILIFY [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Nursing<BR>                        <BR>                        Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking ABILIFY [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Concomitant Medication<BR>                        <BR>                        Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Alcohol<BR>                        <BR>                        Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking ABILIFY [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Heat Exposure and Dehydration<BR>                        <BR>                        Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Sugar Content<BR>                        <BR>                        Patients should be advised that each mL of ABILIFY Oral Solution contains 400 mg of sucrose and 200 mg of fructose.<BR>                        <BR>                           Phenylketonurics<BR>                        <BR>                        Phenylalanine is a component of aspartame.
