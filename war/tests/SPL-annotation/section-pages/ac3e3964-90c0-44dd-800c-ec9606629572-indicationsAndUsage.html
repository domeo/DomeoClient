In clinical trials, the majority of isolates recovered were Aspergillus fumigatus. There was a small number of cases of culture-proven disease due to species of Aspergillus other than A. fumigatus (see CLINICAL STUDIES, MICROBIOLOGY).<BR>                  Candidemia in nonneutropenic patients and the following Candida infections: disseminated infections in skin and infections in abdomen, kidney, bladder wall, and wounds (see CLINICAL STUDIES, MICROBIOLOGY).<BR>                  Esophageal candidiasis (see CLINICAL STUDIES, MICROBIOLOGY).<BR>                  Serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium apiospermum (asexual form of Pseudallescheria boydii) and Fusarium spp. including Fusarium solani, in patients intolerant of, or refractory to, other therapy (see CLINICAL STUDIES, MICROBIOLOGY).<BR>                  Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (including histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organism(s). Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known. However, once these results become available, antifungal therapy should be adjusted accordingly.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
