Its empirical formula is C16H14F2N3NaO4S x 1.5 H2O, with a molecular weight of 432.4. The structural formula is:<BR>                  <BR>                  Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is a white to cream color powder and is racemic. Pantoprazole has weakly basic and acidic properties. Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is freely soluble in water and ethanol. <BR>                  The stability of the compound in aqueous solution is pH-dependent. The rate of degradation increases with decreasing pH. At ambient temperature, the degradation half-life is approximately 2.8 hours at pH 5 and approximately 220 hours at pH 7.8.  <BR>                  Pantoprazole sodium USP is supplied as a delayed-release tablet for oral administration, available in 2 strengths. Each delayed-release tablet contains 45.1 mg or 22.6 mg of pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (equivalent to 40 mg or 20 mg pantoprazole, respectively) with the following inactive ingredients: calcium stearate, crospovidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, iron oxide black, isopropyl alcohol, mannitol, methacrylic acid copolymer, methylated spirit, N-butyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, shellac, sodium carbonate anhydrous, synthetic yellow iron oxide, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate, zein.<BR>                  USP dissolution test is pending.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     Structure<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
