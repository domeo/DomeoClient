However, in rat <BR>reproduction studies, an increase in stillborn pups, a decrease in pup weight <BR>and an increase in pup deaths during the first 7 days postpartum occurred <BR>following maternal exposure to 12 mg/kg/day [1.5 times the maximum recommended <BR>human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis] during gestation or <BR>7.5 mg/kg/day (0.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) <BR>during gestation and lactation. There was no evidence of developmental <BR>neurotoxicity in the surviving offspring of rats treated with 12 mg/kg/day <BR>during gestation. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was 5 mg/kg/day (0.6 <BR>times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). Fluoxetine should be <BR>used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk <BR>to the fetus. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Treatment of Pregnant Women during the Third <BR>TrimesterNeonates exposed to fluoxetine, SNRIs or SSRIs, late in the third <BR>trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, <BR>respiratory support and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately <BR>upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, <BR>cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, <BR>vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, <BR>jitteriness, irritability and constant crying. These features are consistent <BR>with either a direct toxic effect of SNRIs and SSRIs or, possibly, a drug <BR>discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical <BR>picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome. <BR>                        Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for <BR>persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 <BR>per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with <BR>substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective case control <BR>study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants <BR>were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately 6-fold higher <BR>for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of <BR>gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during <BR>pregnancy. There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for <BR>PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has <BR>investigated the potential risk. The study did not include enough cases with <BR>exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of <BR>PPHN risk. <BR>                        When treating pregnant women with fluoxetine during the third trimester, the <BR>physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and potential <BR>benefits of treatment. Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal <BR>study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the <BR>beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during <BR>pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than <BR>women who continued antidepressant medication. <BR>                        The physician may consider tapering fluoxetine in the third trimester.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.2 Labor and Delivery<BR>                     <BR>                        The effect of fluoxetine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. However, <BR>because fluoxetine crosses the placenta and because of the possibility that <BR>fluoxetine may have adverse effects on the newborn, fluoxetine should be used <BR>during labor and delivery only if the potential benefit justifies the potential <BR>risk to the fetus. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        Because fluoxetine is excreted in human milk, nursing while on fluoxetine is not <BR>recommended. In one breast-milk sample, the concentration of fluoxetine plus <BR>norfluoxetine was 70.4 ng/mL. The concentration in the mother’s plasma was 295 <BR>ng/mL. No adverse effects on the infant were reported. In another case, an <BR>infant nursed by a mother on fluoxetine developed crying, sleep disturbance, <BR>vomiting and watery stools. The infant’s plasma drug levels were 340 ng/mL of <BR>fluoxetine and 208 ng/mL of norfluoxetine on the second day of feeding. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4 Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        The efficacy of fluoxetine for the treatment of major depressive <BR>disorder was demonstrated in two 8- to 9-week placebo-controlled clinical trials <BR>with 315 pediatric outpatients ages 8 to <≤ 18 [see Clinical Studies <BR>(14.1)].<BR>                        <BR>                        The efficacy of fluoxetine for the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in one <BR>13-week placebo-controlled clinical trial with 103 pediatric outpatients ages 7 <BR>to < 18 [see Clinical Studies <BR>(14.2)]. <BR>                        The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients < 8 years of age in <BR>major depressive disorder and < 7 years of age in OCD have not been <BR>established. <BR>                        Fluoxetine pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 21 pediatric patients (ages 6 <BR>to < 18) with major depressive disorder or OCD [see Clinical <BR>Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                        The acute adverse reaction profiles observed in the three studies (N = 418 <BR>randomized; 228 fluoxetine-treated, 190 placebo-treated) were generally similar <BR>to that observed in adult studies with fluoxetine. The longer term adverse <BR>reaction profile observed in the 19-week major depressive disorder study (N = <BR>219 randomized; 109 fluoxetine-treated, 110 placebo-treated) was also similar to <BR>that observed in adult trials with fluoxetine [see Adverse <BR>Reactions (6.1)].<BR>                        <BR>                        Manic reaction, including mania and hypomania, was reported in six (one <BR>mania, five hypomania) out of 228 (2.6%) fluoxetine-treated patients and in 0 <BR>out of 190 (0%) placebo-treated patients. Mania/hypomania led to the <BR>discontinuation of four (1.8%) fluoxetine-treated patients from the acute phases <BR>of the three studies combined. Consequently, regular monitoring for the <BR>occurrence of mania/hypomania is recommended. <BR>                        As with other SSRIs, decreased weight gain has been observed in association <BR>with the use of fluoxetine in children and adolescent patients. After 19 weeks <BR>of treatment in a clinical trial, pediatric subjects treated with fluoxetine <BR>gained an average of 1.1 cm less in height and 1.1 kg less in weight than <BR>subjects treated with placebo. In addition, fluoxetine treatment was associated <BR>with a decrease in alkaline phosphatase levels. The safety of fluoxetine <BR>treatment for pediatric patients has not been systematically assessed for <BR>chronic treatment longer than several months in duration. In particular, there <BR>are no studies that directly evaluate the longer term effects of fluoxetine on <BR>the growth, development and maturation of children and adolescent patients. <BR>Therefore, height and weight should be monitored periodically in pediatric <BR>patients receiving fluoxetine [see Warnings and <BR>Precautions (5.6)].<BR>                        <BR>                        Fluoxetine is approved for use in pediatric patients with MDD and OCD [see Box <BR>Warning and <BR>                                 Warnings <BR>and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                              ]. Anyone considering the use of <BR>fluoxetine in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the <BR>clinical need. <BR>                        Significant toxicity, including myotoxicity, long-term neurobehavioral and <BR>reproductive toxicity and impaired bone development, has been observed following <BR>exposure of juvenile animals to fluoxetine. Some of these effects occurred at <BR>clinically relevant exposures. <BR>                        In a study in which fluoxetine (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg) was orally administered to <BR>young rats from weaning (Postnatal Day 21) through adulthood (Day 90), male and <BR>female sexual development was delayed at all doses, and growth (body weight <BR>gain, femur length) was decreased during the dosing period in animals receiving <BR>the highest dose. At the end of the treatment period, serum levels of creatine <BR>kinase (marker of muscle damage) were increased at the intermediate and high <BR>doses, and abnormal muscle and reproductive organ histopathology (skeletal <BR>muscle degeneration and necrosis, testicular degeneration and necrosis, <BR>epididymal vacuolation and hypospermia) was observed at the high dose. When <BR>animals were evaluated after a recovery period (up to 11 weeks after cessation <BR>of dosing), neurobehavioral abnormalities (decreased reactivity at all doses and <BR>learning deficit at the high dose) and reproductive functional impairment <BR>(decreased mating at all doses and impaired fertility at the high dose) were <BR>seen; in addition, testicular and epididymal microscopic lesions and decreased <BR>sperm concentrations were found in the high dose group, indicating that the <BR>reproductive organ effects seen at the end of treatment were irreversible. The <BR>reversibility of fluoxetine-induced muscle damage was not assessed. Adverse <BR>effects similar to those observed in rats treated with fluoxetine during the <BR>juvenile period have not been reported after administration of fluoxetine to <BR>adult animals. Plasma exposures (AUC) to fluoxetine in juvenile rats receiving <BR>the low, intermediate and high dose in this study were approximately 0.1 to 0.2, <BR>1 to 2, and 5 to 10 times, respectively, the average exposure in pediatric <BR>patients receiving the maximum recommended dose (MRD) of 20 mg/day. Rat <BR>exposures to the major metabolite, norfluoxetine, were approximately 0.3 to 0.8, <BR>1 to 8, and 3 to 20 times, respectively, pediatric exposure at the MRD. <BR>                        A specific effect of fluoxetine on bone development has been reported in mice <BR>treated with fluoxetine during the juvenile period. When mice were treated with <BR>fluoxetine (5 or 20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) for 4 weeks starting at 4 weeks of <BR>age, bone formation was reduced resulting in decreased bone mineral content and <BR>density. These doses did not affect overall growth (body weight gain or femoral <BR>length). The doses administered to juvenile mice in this study are approximately <BR>0.5 and 2 times the MRD for pediatric patients on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis.<BR>                        In another mouse study, administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg <BR>intraperitoneal) during early postnatal development (Postnatal Days 4 to 21) <BR>produced abnormal emotional behaviors (decreased exploratory behavior in <BR>elevated plus-maze, increase shock avoidance latency) in adulthood (12 weeks of <BR>age). The dose used in this study is approximately equal to the pediatric MRD on <BR>a mg/m2 basis. Because of the early dosing period in this <BR>study, the significance of these findings to the approved pediatric use in <BR>humans is uncertain. <BR>                        Safety and effectiveness of fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination in <BR>patients less than 18 years of age have not been established. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5 Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        U.S. fluoxetine clinical trials included 687 patients ≥ 65 years <BR>of age and 93 patients ≥ 75 years of age. The efficacy in geriatric patients has <BR>been established [see <BR>                                 Clinical Studies <BR>(14.1)<BR>                              ]. For pharmacokinetic information in geriatric <BR>patients, [see <BR>                                 Clinical <BR>Pharmacology (12.4)<BR>                              ]. No overall differences in safety or <BR>effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and <BR>other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses <BR>between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older <BR>individuals cannot be ruled out. SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine, have <BR>been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly <BR>patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see <BR>                                 Warnings and <BR>Precautions (5.8)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                        Clinical studies of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination did not include <BR>sufficient numbers of patients ≥ 65 years of age to determine whether they <BR>respond differently from younger patients. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.6 Hepatic Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        In subjects with cirrhosis of the liver, the clearances of fluoxetine and its <BR>active metabolite, norfluoxetine, were decreased, thus increasing the <BR>elimination half-lives of these substances. A lower or less frequent dose of <BR>fluoxetine should be used in patients with cirrhosis. Caution is advised when <BR>using fluoxetine in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect its <BR>metabolism [see <BR>                                 Dosage and <BR>Administration (2.7)<BR>                               and <BR>                                 Clinical <BR>Pharmacology (12.4)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
