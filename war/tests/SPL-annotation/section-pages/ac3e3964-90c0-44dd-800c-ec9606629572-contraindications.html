There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between VFEND (voriconazole) and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing VFEND to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.<BR>                  Coadministration of the CYP3A4 substrates, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine with VFEND are contraindicated since increased plasma concentrations of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsade de pointes (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Drug Interactions, PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions).<BR>                  Coadministration of VFEND with sirolimus is contraindicated because VFEND significantly increases sirolimus concentrations in healthy subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Drug Interactions, PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions).<BR>                  Coadministration of VFEND with rifampin, carbamazepine and long-acting barbiturates is contraindicated since these drugs are likely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Drug Interactions, PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions).<BR>                  Coadministration of VFEND with high-dose ritonavir (400 mg Q12h) is contraindicated because ritonavir (400 mg Q12h) significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects. Coadministration of voriconazole and low-dose ritonavir (100 mg Q12h) should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole. (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Drug Interactions, PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions).<BR>                  Coadministration of VFEND with rifabutin is contraindicated since VFEND significantly increases rifabutin plasma concentrations and rifabutin also significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Drug Interactions, PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions).<BR>                  Coadministration of VFEND with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) is contraindicated because VFEND may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids, which may lead to ergotism.<BR>                  Coadministration of VFEND with St. John's Wort is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Drug Interactions, PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions).<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
