Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.3)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Monitoring of Hepatic Function<BR>                           <BR>                              Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.7) and Adverse Reactions (6.3)<BR>                                 ].<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.3 Visual Disturbances<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.4 Pregnancy Category D<BR>                     <BR>                        Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.<BR>                        In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality.

During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory.<BR>                        Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with these potentially proarrhythmic conditions.<BR>                        Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.8 Laboratory Tests<BR>                     <BR>                        Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of voriconazole therapy.<BR>                        Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.9 Patients with Hepatic Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7)<BR>                           ].<BR>                        Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.10 Patients with Renal Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.8)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function<BR>                     <BR>                        Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole.
