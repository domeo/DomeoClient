Likewise, in <BR>manic-depressive psychosis, depressed patients may experience a shift toward the <BR>manic phase if they are treated with an antidepressant drug. Paranoid delusions, <BR>with or without associated hostility, may be exaggerated. In any of these <BR>circumstances, it may be advisable to reduce the dose of protriptyline or to use <BR>a major tranquilizing drug concurrently.<BR>                  Symptoms, such as anxiety or agitation, may be aggravated in overactive or <BR>agitated patients.<BR>                  The possibility of suicide in depressed patients remains during treatment and <BR>until significant remission occurs. This type of patient should not have access <BR>to large quantities of the drug.<BR>                  Concurrent administration of protriptyline and electroshock therapy may <BR>increase the hazards of therapy. Such treatment should be limited to patients <BR>for whom it is essential.<BR>                  Discontinue the drug several days before elective surgery, if possible.<BR>                  Both elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels have been reported.<BR>                  Information for Patients<BR>                  Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their <BR>families and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with <BR>treatment with protriptyline hydrochloride and should counsel them in its <BR>appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about “Antidepressant Medicines, <BR>Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions” <BR>is available for protriptyline hydrochloride. The prescriber or health <BR>professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to <BR>read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. <BR>Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the <BR>Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The <BR>complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this <BR>document.<BR>                  Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their <BR>prescriber if these occur while taking protriptyline hydrochloride.<BR>                  Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk<BR>                  Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be <BR>alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, <BR>irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor <BR>restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of <BR>depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant <BR>treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of <BR>patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a <BR>day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported <BR>to the patient’s prescriber or health professional, especially if they are <BR>severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. <BR>Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal <BR>thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly <BR>changes in the medication.<BR>                  While on therapy with protriptyline, patients should be advised as to the <BR>possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities required for performance <BR>of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor <BR>vehicle.<BR>                  Drug Interactions<BR>                  When protriptyline is given with anticholinergic agents or sympatho-mimetic <BR>drugs, including epinephrine combined with local anesthetics, close supervision <BR>and careful adjustment of dosages are required.<BR>                  Hyperpyrexia has been reported when tricyclic antidepressants are <BR>administered with anticholinergic agents or with neuroleptic drugs, particularly <BR>during hot weather.<BR>                  Cimetidine is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain tricyclic <BR>antidepressants, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state <BR>concentrations of these drugs. Clinically significant effects have been reported <BR>with the tricyclic antidepressants when used concomitantly with cimetidine. <BR>Increases in plasma levels of tricyclic antidepressants, and in the frequency <BR>and severity of side-effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported <BR>when cimetidine was added to the drug regimen. Discontinuation of cimetidine in <BR>well-controlled patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants and cimetidine may <BR>decrease the plasma levels and efficacy of the antidepressants.<BR>                  Tricyclic antidepressants may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking <BR>ULTRAM (tramadol hydrochloride).<BR>                  Protriptyline may enhance the response to alcohol and the effects of <BR>barbiturates and other CNS depressants.<BR>                  Drugs Metabolized <BR>by Cytochrome P450 2D6<BR>                  The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 <BR>(debrisoquine hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population <BR>(about 7% to 10% of Caucasians are so called “poor metabolizers”); reliable <BR>estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, <BR>African, and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have <BR>higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) <BR>when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 <BR>2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small or quite large (8 fold <BR>increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).<BR>                  In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make <BR>normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a <BR>given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting <BR>drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include <BR>some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many <BR>that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, <BR>and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics, propafenone and flecainide). While all the <BR>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, <BR>and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The <BR>extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on <BR>the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. <BR>Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with any of <BR>the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular <BR>importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a <BR>patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent <BR>and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).<BR>                  Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit <BR>cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either <BR>the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of <BR>these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic <BR>antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels <BR>whenever a TCA is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an <BR>inhibitor of P450 2D6.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
