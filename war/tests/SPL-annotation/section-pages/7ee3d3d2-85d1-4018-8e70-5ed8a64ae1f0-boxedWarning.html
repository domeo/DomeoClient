Incidence rates for these events were estimated from the NSABP P-1 trial (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies: Reduction in Breast Cancer Incidence In High Risk Women). Uterine malignancies consist of both endometrial adenocarcinoma (incidence rate per 1,000 women-years of 2.20 for tamoxifen vs. 0.71 for placebo) and uterine sarcoma (incidence rate per 1,000 women-years of 0.17 for tamoxifen vs. 0.04 for placebo)Updated long-term follow-up data (median length of follow-up is 6.9 years) from NSABP P-1 study. See WARNINGS: Effects on the Uterus: Endometrial Cancer and Uterine Sarcoma. . For stroke, the incidence rate per 1,000 women-years was 1.43 for tamoxifen vs. 1.00 for placeboSee Table 3 under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies. . For pulmonary embolism, the incidence rate per 1,000 women-years was 0.75 for tamoxifen vs. 0.25 for placebo.<BR>                        Some of the strokes, pulmonary emboli, and uterine malignancies were fatal.<BR>                        Healthcare providers should discuss the potential benefits versus the potential risks of these serious events with women at high risk of breast cancer and women with DCIS considering tamoxifen to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer.<BR>                        The benefits of tamoxifen outweigh its risks in women already diagnosed with breast cancer.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               </P></DIV></HTML>
