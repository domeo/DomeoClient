Chemically it is (1S,2S,3R,5S)-3-[7-{[(1R,2S)-2-(3,4-difluorophenyl)cyclopropyl]amino}-5-(propylthio)-3H-[1,2,3]-triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-3-yl]-5-(2-hydroxyethoxy)cyclopentane-1,2-diol. The empirical formula of ticagrelor is C23H28F2N6O4S and its molecular weight is 522.57. The chemical structure of ticagrelor is:<BR>                  <BR>                  Ticagrelor is a crystalline powder with an aqueous solubility of approximately 10 Î¼g/mL at room temperature.<BR>                  BRILINTA tablets for oral administration contain 90 mg of ticagrelor and the following ingredients: mannitol, dibasic calcium phosphate, sodium starch glycolate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, titanium dioxide, talc, polyethylene glycol 400, and ferric oxide yellow.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     chemical structure<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
