USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS<BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           The safety and efficacy of ACIPHEX for GERD have not been established for pediatric patients less than 12 years of age.<BR>                           The safety and efficacy of ACIPHEX for the other adult indications have not been established for pediatric patients.<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.1. Pregnancy<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category B: Teratology studies have been performed in rats at intravenous doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (plasma AUC of 11.8 μg•hr/mL, about 13 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD) and rabbits at intravenous doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUC of 7.3 μg•hr/mL, about 8 times the human exposure at the recommended dose for GERD) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to rabeprazole. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.3. Nursing Mothers<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        Following intravenous administration of 14C-labeled rabeprazole to lactating rats, radioactivity in milk reached levels that were 2- to 7-fold higher than levels in the blood. It is not known if unmetabolized rabeprazole is excreted in human breast milk. Administration of rabeprazole to rats in late gestation and during lactation at doses of 400 mg/kg/day (about 195-times the human dose based on mg/m2) resulted in decreases in body weight gain of the pups. Since many drugs are excreted in milk, and because of the potential for adverse reactions to nursing infants from rabeprazole, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.4. Pediatric Use<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        Use of ACIPHEX in adolescent patients 12 years of age and above for short-term treatment of GERD is supported by a) extrapolation of results from adequate and well-controlled studies that supported the approval of ACIPHEX for adults {see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1, 14.2, 14.3) and INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1.1, 1.2, 1.3)}; b) safety and pharmacokinetic studies performed in adolescent patients {see Pharmacokinetics, <BR>                           Pediatric (12.3)}. The safety and effectiveness of ACIPHEX for the treatment of GERD patients <12 years of age have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of ACIPHEX for other uses have not been established in pediatric patients.<BR>                        In a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study, 111 adolescent patients 12 to 16 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic GERD or suspected or endoscopically proven GERD were randomized and treated with either ACIPHEX 10 mg or ACIPHEX 20 mg once daily for up to 8 weeks for the evaluation of safety and efficacy. The adverse event profile in adolescent patients was similar to that of adults. The related reported adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of patients were headache (5.4%) and nausea (1.8%). There were no adverse reactions reported in these studies that were not previously observed in adults.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.5. Geriatric Use<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ACIPHEX, 19% were 65 years and over, while 4% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.6.

Adverse reactions and laboratory test abnormalities in women occurred at rates similar to those in men.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
