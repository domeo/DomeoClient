The antibody is a chimeric IgG1 directed against CD30. The small molecule, MMAE, is a microtubule disrupting agent. MMAE is covalently attached to the antibody via a linker. Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of ADCETRIS is due to the binding of the ADC to CD30-expressing cells, followed by internalization of the ADC‑CD30 complex, and the release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage. Binding of MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death of the cells.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           QT/QTc Prolongation Potential<BR>                        <BR>                        The effect of brentuximab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm study in 46 evaluable patients with CD30-expressing hematologic malignancies. Administration of brentuximab vedotin did not prolong the mean QTc interval >10 ms from baseline. Small increases in the mean QTc interval (<10 ms) cannot be excluded because this study did not include a placebo arm and a positive control arm.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        The pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin were evaluated in phase 1 trials and in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from 314 patients. The pharmacokinetics of three analytes were determined: the ADC, MMAE, and total antibody. Total antibody had the greatest exposure and had a similar PK profile as the ADC. Hence, data on the PK of the ADC and MMAE have been summarized.<BR>                        <BR>                           Absorption<BR>                        <BR>                        Maximum concentrations of ADC were typically observed close to the end of infusion. A multiexponential decline in ADC serum concentrations was observed with a terminal half-life of approximately 4 to 6 days. Exposures were approximately dose proportional from 1.2 to 2.7 mg/kg. Steady-state of the ADC was achieved within 21 days with every 3-week dosing of ADCETRIS, consistent with the terminal half-life estimate. Minimal to no accumulation of ADC was observed with multiple doses at the every 3-week schedule.<BR>                        The time to maximum concentration for MMAE ranged from approximately 1 to 3 days. Similar to the ADC, steady‑state of MMAE was achieved within 21 days with every 3 week dosing of ADCETRIS. MMAE exposures decreased with continued administration of ADCETRIS with approximately 50% to 80% of the exposure of the first dose being observed at subsequent doses.<BR>                        <BR>                           Distribution<BR>                        <BR>                        In vitro, the binding of MMAE to human plasma proteins ranged from 68-82%. MMAE is not likely to displace or to be displaced by highly protein-bound drugs. In vitro, MMAE was a substrate of P-gp and was not a potent inhibitor of P-gp.<BR>                        In humans, the mean steady state volume of distribution was approximately 6-10 L for ADC.<BR>                        <BR>                           Metabolism<BR>                        <BR>                        In vivo data in animals and humans suggest that only a small fraction of MMAE released from brentuximab vedotin is metabolized. In vitro data indicate that the MMAE metabolism that occurs is primarily via oxidation by CYP3A4/5. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that MMAE inhibits CYP3A4/5 but not other CYP isoforms. MMAE did not induce any major CYP450 enzymes in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.<BR>                        <BR>                           Elimination<BR>                        <BR>                        MMAE appeared to follow metabolite kinetics, with the elimination of MMAE appearing to be limited by its rate of release from ADC. An excretion study was undertaken in patients who received a dose of 1.8 mg/kg of ADCETRIS. Approximately 24% of the total MMAE administered as part of the ADC during an ADCETRIS infusion was recovered in both urine and feces over a 1-week period. Of the recovered MMAE, approximately 72% was recovered in the feces and the majority of the excreted MMAE was unchanged.<BR>                        <BR>                           Effects of Gender, Age and Race<BR>                        <BR>                        Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender, age and race do not have a meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
