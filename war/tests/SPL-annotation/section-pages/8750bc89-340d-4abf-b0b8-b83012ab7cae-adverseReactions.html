Indications clinically studied in U.S. trials included duodenal ulcer, resistant ulcer and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The international clinical trials were double-blind and open-label in design. The most common adverse reactions reported (i.e., with an incidence rate ≥ 2%) from omeprazole-treated patients enrolled in these studies included headache (6.9%), abdominal pain (5.2%), nausea (4%), diarrhea (3.7%), vomiting (3.2%) and flatulence (2.7%). <BR>                        Additional adverse reactions that were reported with an incidence ≥ 1% included acid regurgitation (1.9%), upper respiratory infection (1.9%), constipation (1.5%), dizziness (1.5%), rash (1.5%), asthenia (1.3%), back pain (1.1%) and cough (1.1%). <BR>                        The clinical trial safety profile in patients greater than 65 years of age was similar to that in patients 65 years of age or less. <BR>                        The clinical trial safety profile in pediatric patients who received omeprazole delayed-release capsules was similar to that in adult patients. Unique to the pediatric population, however, adverse reactions of the respiratory system were most frequently reported in the 2 to 16 year age group (18.5%). Similarly, accidental injuries were reported frequently in the 2 to 16 year age group (3.8%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     6.2 Clinical Trials Experience with Omeprazole in Combination Therapy for H. pylori Eradication <BR>                     <BR>                        In clinical trials using either dual therapy with omeprazole and clarithromycin, or triple therapy with omeprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin, no adverse reactions unique to these drug combinations were observed. Adverse reactions observed were limited to those previously reported with omeprazole, clarithromycin or amoxicillin alone. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Dual Therapy (omeprazole/clarithromycin) <BR>                           <BR>                              Adverse reactions observed in controlled clinical trials using combination therapy with omeprazole and clarithromycin (n = 346) that differed from those previously described for omeprazole alone were taste perversion (15%), tongue discoloration (2%), rhinitis (2%), pharyngitis (1%) and flu-syndrome (1%).

None of these occurred at a higher frequency than that reported by patients taking antimicrobial agents alone.

Because these reactions are voluntarily reported from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their actual frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Body as a Whole: <BR>                           Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, interstitial nephritis, urticaria, (see also Skin below); fever; pain; fatigue; malaise <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Cardiovascular:<BR>                            Chest pain or angina, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations, elevated blood pressure, peripheral edema <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Endocrine:<BR>                            Gynecomastia <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Gastrointestinal:<BR>                            Pancreatitis (some fatal), anorexia, irritable colon, fecal discoloration, esophageal candidiasis, mucosal atrophy of the tongue, stomatitis, abdominal swelling, dry mouth. During treatment with omeprazole, gastric fundic gland polyps have been noted rarely. These polyps are benign and appear to be reversible when treatment is discontinued. Gastroduodenal carcinoids have been reported in patients with ZE syndrome on long-term treatment with omeprazole. This finding is believed to be a manifestation of the underlying condition, which is known to be associated with such tumors. <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Hepatic:<BR>                            Liver disease including hepatic failure (some fatal), liver necrosis (some fatal), hepatic encephalopathy hepatocellular disease, cholestatic disease, mixed hepatitis, jaundice and elevations of liver function tests [ALT, AST, GGT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin] <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Metabolic/Nutritional:<BR>                            Hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, weight gain <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Musculoskeletal:<BR>                            Muscle weakness, myalgia, muscle cramps, joint pain, leg pain <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Nervous System/Psychiatric:<BR>                            Psychiatric and sleep disturbances including depression, agitation, aggression, hallucinations, confusion, insomnia, nervousness, apathy, somnolence, anxiety and dream abnormalities; tremors, paresthesia; vertigo <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Respiratory:<BR>                            Epistaxis, pharyngeal pain <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Skin:<BR>                            Severe generalized skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis (some fatal), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and erythema multiforme; photosensitivity; urticaria; rash; skin inflammation; pruritus; petechiae; purpura; alopecia; dry skin; hyperhidrosis <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Special Senses:<BR>                            Tinnitus, taste perversion <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Ocular:<BR>                            Optic atrophy, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, optic neuritis, dry eye syndrome, ocular irritation, blurred vision, double vision <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Urogenital:<BR>                            Interstitial nephritis, hematuria, proteinuria, elevated serum creatinine, microscopic pyuria, urinary tract infection, glycosuria, urinary frequency, testicular pain <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Hematologic:<BR>                            Agranulocytosis (some fatal), hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, leucocytosis <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
