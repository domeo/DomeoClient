Before starting EPZICOM, review medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir-containing product in order to avoid reintroduction in a patient with a history of hypersensitivity to abacavir.<BR>                     In one controlled study (CNA30021), more patients taking ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe hypersensitivity reactions compared with patients taking ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily.<BR>                     As part of a triple-drug regimen, EPZICOM Tablets are recommended for use with antiretroviral agents from different pharmacological classes and not with other nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors.<BR>                  <BR>                  See WARNINGS, ADVERSE REACTIONS, and Description of Clinical Studies.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Description of Clinical Studies:<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           EPZICOM:<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        There have been no clinical trials conducted with EPZICOM (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for information about bioequivalence of EPZICOM). One EPZICOM Tablet given once daily is an alternative regimen to EPIVIR Tablets 300 mg once daily plus ZIAGEN Tablets 2 x 300 mg once daily as a component of antiretroviral therapy.<BR>                        The following study was conducted with the individual components of EPZICOM.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Therapy-Naive Adults:<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           CNA30021 was an international, multi-center, double-blind, controlled study in which 770 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily or ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with EPIVIR 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily. The double-blind treatment duration was at least 48 weeks. Study participants had a mean age of 37 years, were: male (81%), Caucasian (54%), black (27%), and American Hispanic (15%). The median baseline CD4+ cell count was 262 cells/mm3 (range: 21 to 918 cells/mm3) and the median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.89 log10 copies/mL (range: 2.60 to 6.99 log10 copies/mL).<BR>                        The outcomes of randomized treatment are provided in Table 3.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="660.000" ID="id_4f121c21-8c53-445a-beb5-38db378c8441"><BR>                           <caption ID="id_74fbf1df-0267-4538-b893-42926730fbba">Table 3.
