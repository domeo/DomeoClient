Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with TRETIN•X. It also is advisable to "rest" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of TRETIN•X is begun.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               </P></DIV></HTML>
