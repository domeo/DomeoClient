In the controlled clinical trials establishing the effectiveness of fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP in OCD, patients were titrated within a dose range of 100 to 300 mg/day. Consequently, the dose should be increased in 50 mg increments every 4 to 7 days, as tolerated, until maximum therapeutic benefit is achieved, not to exceed 300 mg per day. It is advisable that a total daily dose of more than 100 mg should be given in two divided doses. If the doses are not equal, the larger dose should be given at bedtime.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.2 Pediatric Population (Children and Adolescents)<BR>                     <BR>                        The recommended starting dose for fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP in pediatric populations (ages 8 to 17 years) is 25 mg, administered as a single daily dose at bedtime. In a controlled clinical trial establishing the effectiveness of fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP in OCD, pediatric patients (ages 8 to 17) were titrated within a dose range of 50 to 200 mg/day. Physicians should consider age and gender differences when dosing pediatric patients. The maximum dose in children up to age 11 should not exceed 200 mg/day. Therapeutic effect in female children may be achieved with lower doses. Dose adjustment in adolescents (up to the adult maximum dose of 300 mg) may be indicated to achieve therapeutic benefit. The dose should be increased in 25 mg increments every 4 to 7 days, as tolerated, until maximum therapeutic benefit is achieved. It is advisable that a total daily dose of more than 50 mg should be given in two divided doses. If the two divided doses are not equal, the larger dose should be given at bedtime.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.3 Elderly or Hepatically Impaired Patients<BR>                     <BR>                        Elderly patients and those with hepatic impairment have been observed to have a decreased clearance of fluvoxamine maleate. Consequently, it may be appropriate to modify the initial dose and the subsequent dose titration for these patient groups.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.4 Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester<BR>                     <BR>                        Neonates exposed to fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP and other SSRIs or SNRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding and may be at risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. When treating pregnant women with fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. The physician may consider tapering fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP in the third trimester.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.5 Switching Patients to or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor<BR>                     <BR>                        At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of therapy with fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP before starting an MAOI.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.6 Maintenance/Continuation Extended Treatment <BR>                     <BR>                        It is generally agreed that obsessive compulsive disorder requires several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. The benefit of maintaining patients with OCD on fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP after achieving a response for an average duration of about 4 weeks in a 10 week single-blind phase during which patients were titrated to effect was demonstrated in a controlled trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The physician who elects to use fluvoxamine maleate tablets USP for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.7 Discontinuation of Treatment With Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets USP<BR>                     <BR>                        Symptoms associated with discontinuation of other SSRIs or SNRIs have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
