Variants in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) gene are associated with an increased risk of ototoxicity in children treated with cisplatin (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<BR>                           ).<BR><BR>                        All children should have audiometric monitoring performed prior to initiation of therapy prior to each subsequent dose, and for several years post therapy.  Advanced testing methods may allow for earlier detection of hearing loss in an attempt to facilitate the rapid initiation of interventions that can limit the potential adverse impact of hearing impairment on a child's cognitive and social development.<BR><BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Geriatric Use<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        Insufficient data are available from clinical trials of cisplatin in the treatment of metastatic testicular tumors or advanced bladder cancer to determine whether elderly patients respond differently than younger patients. In four clinical trials of combination chemotherapy for advanced ovarian carcinoma, 1484 patients received cisplatin either in combination with cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel. Of these, 426 (29%) were older than 65 years. In these trials, age was not found to be a prognostic factor for survival. However, in a later secondary analysis for one of these trials, elderly patients were found to have shorter survival compared with younger patients. In all four trials, elderly patients experienced more severe neutropenia than younger patients. Higher incidences of severe thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were also seen in elderly compared with younger patients, although not in all cisplatin-containing treatment arms. In the two trials where nonhematologic toxicity was evaluated according to age, elderly patients had a numerically higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience suggests that elderly patients may be more susceptible to myelosuppression, infectious complications, and nephrotoxicity than younger patients.<BR><BR>                        Cisplatin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and is contraindicated in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and renal function should be monitored.<BR><BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
