The recommended everolimus therapeutic range is 3 to 8 ng/mL. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.7)] Careful attention should be made to clinical signs and symptoms, tissue biopsies, and laboratory parameters. It is important to monitor everolimus blood concentrations, in patients with hepatic impairment, during concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors, when switching cyclosporine formulations and/or when cyclosporine dosing is reduced according to recommended target concentrations. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.7 and 12.8)]  <BR>                        There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced. There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and thus, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced. [See Drug Interactions (7.2)]<BR>                        The everolimus recommended therapeutic range of 3 to 8 ng/mL is based on an LC/MS/MS assay method. Currently in clinical practice, everolimus whole blood trough concentrations may be measured by chromatographic or immunoassay methodologies. Because the measured everolimus whole blood trough concentrations depend on the assay used, individual patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable. Consideration of assay results must be made with knowledge of the specific assay used. Therefore, communication should be maintained with the laboratory performing the assay.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.4     Therapeutic Drug Monitoring- Cyclosporine in Kidney Transplant Patients<BR>                     <BR>                        Both cyclosporine doses and the target range for whole blood trough concentrations should be reduced, when given in a regimen with Zortress, in order to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Drug Interactions (7.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.8)]<BR>                        The recommended cyclosporine therapeutic ranges when administered with Zortress are 100 to 200 ng/mL through Month 1 post-transplant, 75 to 150 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 post-transplant, 50 to 100 ng/mL at Month 4 post-transplant, and 25 to 50 ng/mL from Month 6 through Month 12 post-transplant. The median trough concentrations observed in the clinical trial ranged between 161 to 185 ng/mL through Month 1 post-transplant and between 111 to 140 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 post-transplant. The median trough concentration was 99 ng/mL at Month 4 post-transplant and ranged between 46 to 75 ng/mL from Months 6 through Month 12 post-transplant.

In renal transplant patients, the cyclosporine dose should be based on cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations.

Zortress has not been evaluated in clinical trials with other formulations of cyclosporine. Prior to dose reduction of cyclosporine it should be ascertained that steady-state everolimus whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. There is an interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus, and consequently, everolimus concentrations may decrease if cyclosporine exposure is reduced.

The median tacrolimus trough concentrations ranged between 7 to 8.1 ng/mL at Weeks 5 and 6 post-transplant, between 5.2 to 5.6 ng/mL at Months 2 and 3 post-transplant, and between 4.3 to 4.9 ng/mL between Months 4 and 12 post-transplant.

Prior to dose reduction of tacrolimus it should be ascertained that the steady-state everolimus whole blood trough concentration is at least 3 ng/mL. Unlike the interaction between cyclosporine and everolimus, tacrolimus does not affect everolimus trough concentrations, and consequently, everolimus concentrations do not decrease if the tacrolimus exposure is reduced.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.6     Administration<BR>                     <BR>                        Zortress tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water and not crushed before use.<BR>                        Administer Zortress consistently approximately 12 hours apart with or without food to minimize variability in absorption and at the same time as cyclosporine or tacrolimus.

For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), the initial daily dose should be reduced by approximately one-third of the normally recommended daily dose. For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C), the initial daily dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of the normally recommended daily dose. Further dose adjustment and/or dose titration should be made if a patient’s whole blood trough concentration of everolimus, as measured by an LC/MS/MS assay, is not within the target trough concentration range of 3 to 8 ng/mL.
