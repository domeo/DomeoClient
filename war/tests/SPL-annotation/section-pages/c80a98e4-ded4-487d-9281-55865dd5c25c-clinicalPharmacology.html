By the kinetic method in <BR>mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Absorption and Excretion: Dapsone, when <BR>given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the <BR>daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble <BR>metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be <BR>maintained with the usual dosage. <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Blood Levels: Detected a few minutes <BR>after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4-8 hours. Daily <BR>administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. <BR>With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 μg/ml with a range of <BR>0.1-7.0 μg/ml. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from <BR>ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the <BR>same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 - 100 mg) in leprosy <BR>patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory <BR>concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life. <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
