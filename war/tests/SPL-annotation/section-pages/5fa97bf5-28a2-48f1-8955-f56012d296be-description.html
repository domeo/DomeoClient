The chemical name is 3-(4-amino-1-oxo 1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl) piperidine-2,6-dione and it has the following chemical structure: <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>                  3-(4-amino-1-oxo 1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl) piperidine-2,6-dione<BR>                  The empirical formula for lenalidomide is C13H13N3O3,, and the gram molecular weight is 259.3.<BR>                  Lenalidomide is an off-white to pale-yellow solid powder. It is soluble in organic solvent/water mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more soluble in organic solvents and low pH solutions. Solubility was significantly lower in less acidic buffers, ranging from about 0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can exist as the optically active forms S(-) and R(+), and is produced as a racemic mixture with a net optical rotation of zero.<BR>                  REVLIMID is available in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 25 mg capsules for oral administration. Each capsule contains lenalidomide as the active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients: lactose anhydrous, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. The 5 mg and 25 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide and black ink. The 2.5 mg and 10 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, FD&C blue #2, yellow iron oxide, titanium dioxide and black ink. The 15 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, FD&C blue #2, titanium dioxide and black ink.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     lenalidomide chemical structure<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
