A <BR>patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other <BR>Serious Mental Illness and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for <BR>doxepin. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their <BR>families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist <BR>them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to <BR>discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any <BR>questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted <BR>at the end of this document.<BR>                  Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their <BR>prescriber if these occur while taking doxepin.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk<BR>                  Patients, their families and their caregivers should be <BR>encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, <BR>insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia <BR>(psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, <BR>worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during <BR>antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and <BR>caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such <BR>symptoms on a day to day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms <BR>should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, <BR>especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the <BR>patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an <BR>increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very <BR>close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>Drug Interactions<BR><BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme <BR>cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the <BR>Caucasian population (about 7 to 10% of Caucasians are so called "poor <BR>metabolizers"); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme <BR>activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor <BR>metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic <BR>antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug <BR>metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or <BR>quite large (8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).<BR>                  In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make <BR>normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a <BR>given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting <BR>drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include <BR>some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many <BR>that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, <BR>and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the <BR>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., citalopram, escitalopram, <BR>fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the <BR>extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose <BR>clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the <BR>pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the <BR>coadministration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one <BR>class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before <BR>initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the <BR>long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be <BR>necessary).<BR>                  Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit <BR>cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either <BR>the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of <BR>these other drugs is withdrawn from cotherapy, an increased dose of tricyclic <BR>antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels <BR>whenever a TCA is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an <BR>inhibitor of P450 2D6.<BR>                  Doxepin is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 (with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 as minor <BR>pathways). Inhibitors or substrates of CYP2D6 (i.e., quinidine, selective <BR>serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) may increase the plasma concentration of <BR>doxepin when administered concomitantly. The extent of interaction depends on <BR>the variability of effect on CYP2D6. The clinical significance of this <BR>interaction with doxepin has not been systematically evaluated.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  MAO Inhibitors<BR>                  Serious side effects and even death have been reported following <BR>the concomitant use of certain drugs with MAO inhibitors. Therefore, MAO <BR>inhibitors should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to the cautious <BR>initiation of therapy with doxepin. The exact length of time may vary and is <BR>dependent upon the particular MAO inhibitor being used, the length of time it <BR>has been administered, and the dosage involved.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Cimetidine<BR>                  Cimetidine has been reported to produce clinically significant <BR>fluctuations in steady-state serum concentrations of various tricyclic <BR>antidepressants. Serious anticholinergic symptoms (i.e., severe dry mouth, <BR>urinary retention and blurred vision) have been associated with elevations in <BR>the serum levels of tricyclic antidepressant when cimetidine therapy is <BR>initiated. Additionally, higher than expected tricyclic antidepressant levels <BR>have been observed when they are begun in patients already taking cimetidine. In <BR>patients who have been reported to be well controlled on tricyclic <BR>antidepressants receiving concurrent cimetidine therapy, discontinuation of <BR>cimetidine has been reported to decrease established steady-state serum <BR>tricyclic antidepressant levels and compromise their therapeutic effects.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Alcohol<BR>                  It should be borne in mind that alcohol ingestion may increase <BR>the danger inherent in any intentional or unintentional doxepin overdosage. This <BR>is especially important in patients who may use alcohol excessively.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Tolazamide<BR>                  A case of severe hypoglycemia has been reported in a type II <BR>diabetic patient maintained on tolazamide (1 gm/day) 11 days after the addition <BR>of doxepin (75 mg/day).<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>Drowsiness<BR>                  Since drowsiness may occur with the use of this drug, patients <BR>should be warned of the possibility and cautioned against driving a car or <BR>operating dangerous machinery while taking the drug. Patients should also be <BR>cautioned that their response to alcohol may be potentiated.<BR>                  Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over sedation in the elderly; elderly <BR>patients generally should be started on low doses of doxepin and observed <BR>closely (see      PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>Suicide<BR>                  Since suicide is an inherent risk in any depressed patient and <BR>may remain so until significant improvement has occurred, patients should be <BR>closely supervised during the early course of therapy. Prescriptions should be <BR>written for the smallest feasible amount.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>Psychosis<BR>                  Should increased symptoms of psychosis or shift to manic <BR>symptomatology occur, it may be necessary to reduce dosage or add a major <BR>tranquilizer to the dosage regimen.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>Pediatric Use<BR>                  Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not <BR>been established (see        BOX WARNING and        WARNINGS: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk).<BR>                  Anyone considering the use of doxepin in a child or adolescent must balance <BR>the potential risks with the clinical need.<BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>Geriatric Use<BR>                  A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical <BR>studies of doxepin included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to <BR>define a difference in response from younger subjects. Other reported clinical <BR>experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and <BR>younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be <BR>cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the <BR>greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of <BR>concomitant disease or other drug therapy.<BR>                  The extent of renal excretion of doxepin has not been determined. Because <BR>elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should <BR>be taken in dose selections.<BR>                  Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over sedation in the elderly; elderly <BR>patients generally should be started on low doses of doxepin and observed <BR>closely.
