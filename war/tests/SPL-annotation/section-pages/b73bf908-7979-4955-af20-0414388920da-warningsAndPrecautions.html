Consider bone mineral density <BR>monitoring. (5.1) <BR>                           Increases in total cholesterol may occur. Consider cholesterol monitoring. <BR>(5.2) <BR>                           Fatigue, dizziness and somnolence may occur. Exercise caution when operating <BR>machinery. (5.4) <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.1 Bone Effects<BR>                     <BR>                        Use of letrozole may cause decreases in bone mineral density <BR>(BMD). Consideration should be given to monitoring BMD. Results of a substudy to <BR>evaluate safety in the adjuvant setting comparing the effect on lumbar spine (L2 <BR>to L4) bone mineral density (BMD) of adjuvant treatment with letrozole to that <BR>with tamoxifen showed at 24 months a median decrease in lumbar spine BMD of 4.1% <BR>in the letrozole arm compared to a median increase of 0.3% in the tamoxifen arm <BR>(difference = 4.4%) (P < 0.0001) [see Adverse reactions <BR>(6.1)]. Updated results from the BMD sub-study in the extended <BR>adjuvant setting demonstrated that at 2 years patients receiving letrozole had a <BR>median decrease from baseline of 3.8% in hip BMD compared to a median decrease <BR>of 2% in the placebo group. The changes from baseline in lumbar spine BMD in <BR>letrozole and placebo treated groups were not significantly different [see Adverse Reactions <BR>(6.2)]. <BR>                        In the adjuvant trial the incidence of bone fractures at any time after <BR>randomization was 13.8% for letrozole and 10.5% for tamoxifen. The incidence of <BR>osteoporosis was 5.1% for letrozole and 2.7% for tamoxifen [see Adverse Reactions <BR>(6.1)]. In the extended adjuvant trial the incidence of bone <BR>fractures at any time after randomization was 13.3% for letrozole and 7.8% for <BR>placebo. The incidence of new osteoporosis was 14.5% for letrozole and 7.8% for <BR>placebo [see Adverse Reactions <BR>(6.3)]. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.2 Cholesterol<BR>                     <BR>                        Consideration should be given to monitoring serum cholesterol. In <BR>the adjuvant trial hypercholesterolemia was reported in 52.3% of letrozole <BR>patients and 28.6% of tamoxifen patients. CTC grade 3 to 4 hypercholesterolemia <BR>was reported in 0.4% of letrozole patients and 0.1% of tamoxifen patients. Also <BR>in the adjuvant setting, an increase of > 1.5 X ULN in total cholesterol <BR>(generally non-fasting) was observed in patients on monotherapy who had baseline <BR>total serum cholesterol within the normal range (i.e., < = 1.5 X ULN) in <BR>151/1843 (8.2%) on letrozole vs. 57/1,840 (3.2%). Lipid lowering medications <BR>were required for 25% of patients on letrozole and 16% on tamoxifen [see Adverse Reactions <BR>(6.1)]. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.3 Hepatic Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        Subjects with cirrhosis and severe hepatic impairment who were <BR>dosed with 2.5 mg of letrozole experienced approximately twice the exposure to <BR>letrozole as healthy volunteers with normal liver function. Therefore, a dose <BR>reduction is recommended for this patient population. The effect of hepatic <BR>impairment on letrozole exposure in cancer patients with elevated bilirubin <BR>levels has not been determined [see Dosage and <BR>Administration (2.5)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.4 Fatigue and Dizziness<BR>                     <BR>                        Because fatigue, dizziness and somnolence have been reported with <BR>the use of letrozole, caution is advised when driving or using machinery until <BR>it is known how the patient reacts to letrozole use. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.5 Laboratory Test Abnormalities<BR>                     <BR>                        No dose related effect of letrozole on any hematologic or <BR>clinical chemistry parameter was evident. Moderate decreases in lymphocyte <BR>counts, of uncertain clinical significance, were observed in some patients <BR>receiving letrozole 2.5 mg. This depression was transient in about half of those <BR>affected. Two patients on letrozole developed thrombocytopenia; relationship to <BR>the study drug was unclear. Patient withdrawal due to laboratory abnormalities, <BR>whether related to study treatment or not, was infrequent. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
