Blocking this interaction prevents CCR5-tropic HIV-1 entry into cells.<BR>                  <BR>                  SELZENTRY is available as film-coated tablets for oral administration containing either 150 or 300 mg of maraviroc and the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, dibasic calcium phosphate (anhydrous), sodium starch glycolate, and magnesium stearate. The film coat [OpadryÂ® II Blue (85G20583)] contains FD&C blue #2 aluminum lake, soya lecithin, polyethylene glycol (macrogol 3350), polyvinyl alcohol, talc and titanium dioxide. <BR>                  Maraviroc is chemically described as 4,4-difluoro-N-{(1S)-3-[exo-3-(3-isopropyl-5-methyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-8-yl]-1-phenylpropyl}cyclohexanecarboxamide.<BR>                  The molecular formula is C29H41F2N5O and the structural formula is:<BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>                  Maraviroc is a white to pale colored powder with a molecular weight of 513.67. It is highly soluble across the physiological pH range (pH 1.0 to 7.5).<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     Chemical Structure<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
