Patients were required to have either ECG changes compatible with new ischemia (without ST-elevation) or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or T to at least twice the upper limit of normal. The patient population was largely Caucasian (82%) and included 38% women, and 52% patients ≥65 years of age.<BR><BR>                        <BR> <BR>Patients were randomized to receive clopidogrel bisulfate (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily) or placebo, and were treated for up to one year. Patients also received aspirin (75 to 325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies such as heparin. The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors was not permitted for three days prior to randomization.<BR> <BR>The number of patients experiencing the primary outcome (CV death, MI, or stroke) was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel bisulfate-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the placebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10% to 28%;

The benefits associated with clopidogrel bisulfate were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of clopidogrel bisulfate was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75 to 325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, non-study antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE. <BR><BR>                        <BR><BR>                        The use of clopidogrel bisulfate in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the clopidogrel bisulfate group, 126 patients [2%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the clopidogrel bisulfate group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of clopidogrel bisulfate in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting), (2253 patients [36%] in the clopidogrel bisulfate group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4%).<BR><BR>                        <BR><BR>                        <BR>                           <BR><BR>                           COMMIT<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR> <BR>In patients with STEMI, the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel bisulfate were evaluated in the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, COMMIT. COMMIT included 45,852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of the symptoms of myocardial infarction with supporting ECG abnormalities (i.e., ST-elevation, ST-depression or left bundle-branch block). Patients were randomized to receive clopidogrel bisulfate (75 mg once daily) or placebo, in combination with aspirin (162 mg per day), for 28 days or until hospital discharge, whichever came

The overall relative risk reduction (9.8% vs. 10.6%) was 8.7%, p=0.045. Similar results were obtained when all-cause mortality and all-cause strokes were counted instead of vascular mortality and ischemic strokes (risk reduction 6.9%). In patients who survived an on-study stroke or myocardial infarction, the incidence of subsequent events was lower in the clopidogrel bisulfate group.<BR><BR><BR><BR> <BR>The curves showing the overall event rate are shown in Figure 8. The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 3-year follow-up period. <BR><BR>                        The statistical significance favoring clopidogrel bisulfate over aspirin was marginal (p=0.045). However, because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke, the effect of clopidogrel bisulfate is substantial.<BR> <BR>The CAPRIE trial included a population that was randomized on the basis of 3 entry criteria. The efficacy of clopidogrel bisulfate relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these randomized subgroups (p=0.043). It is not clear whether this difference is real or a chance occurrence. Although the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of clopidogrel bisulfate over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups, the benefit appeared to be strongest in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral vascular disease (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) and weaker in stroke patients. In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction, clopidogrel bisulfate was not numerically superior to aspirin.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Figure 8: Fatal or Non-Fatal Vascular Events in the CAPRIE Study<BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     14.3  Lack of Established Benefit of Clopidogrel Bisulfate plus Aspirin in Patients with Multiple Risk Factors or Established Vascular Disease<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR><BR>                        <BR>                           CHARISMA <BR>                           <BR> <BR><BR>                        The CHARISMA trial was a 15,603 subject, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study comparing clopidogrel bisulfate (75 mg daily) to placebo for prevention of ischemic events in patients with vascular disease or multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis.
