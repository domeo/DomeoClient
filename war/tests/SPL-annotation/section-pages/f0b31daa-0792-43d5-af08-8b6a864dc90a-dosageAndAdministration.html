Based on experience with exemestane at <BR>repeated doses up to 200 mg daily that demonstrated a moderate increase in <BR>non-life threatening adverse events, dosage adjustment does not appear to be <BR>necessary (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special <BR>Populations and PRECAUTIONS).<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
