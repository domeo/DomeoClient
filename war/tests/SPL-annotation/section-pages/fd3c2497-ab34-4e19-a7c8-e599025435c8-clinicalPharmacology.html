The mean fasting gastrin concentrations increased from baseline during treatment with KAPIDEX 30 mg and 60 mg doses.  In patients treated for more than 6 months, mean serum gastrin levels increased during approximately the first 3 months of treatment and were stable for the remainder of treatment.

Dexlansoprazole is eliminated with a half-life of approximately 1 to 2 hours in healthy subjects and in patients with symptomatic GERD.

Oxidative metabolites are formed by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system including hydroxylation mainly by CYP2C19, and oxidation to the sulfone by CYP3A4. <BR>                              CYP2C19 is a polymorphic liver enzyme which exhibits three phenotypes in the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates; extensive metabolizers (*1/*1), intermediate metabolizers (*1/mutant) and poor metabolizers (mutant/mutant).  Dexlansoprazole is the major circulating component in plasma regardless of CYP2C19 metabolizer status. In CYP2C19 intermediate and extensive metabolizers, the major plasma metabolites are 5-hydroxy dexlansoprazole and its glucuronide conjugate, while in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers dexlansoprazole sulfone is the major plasma metabolite.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Elimination<BR>                              <BR>                              Following the administration of KAPIDEX, no unchanged dexlansoprazole is excreted in urine. Following the administration of [14C]dexlansoprazole to 6 healthy male subjects, approximately 50.7% (standard deviation (SD): 9.0%) of the administered radioactivity was excreted in urine and 47.6% (SD: 7.3%) in the feces. Apparent clearance (CL/F) in healthy subjects was 11.4 to 11.6 L/h, respectively, after 5-days of 30 or 60 mg once daily administration.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Effect of CYP2C19 Polymorphism on Systemic Exposure of Dexlansoprazole<BR>                              <BR>                              Systemic exposure of dexlansoprazole is generally higher in intermediate and poor metabolizers.  In male Japanese subjects who received a single dose of KAPIDEX 30 mg or 60 mg (N=2 to 6 subjects/group), mean dexlansoprazole Cmax and AUC values were up to 2 times higher in intermediate compared to extensive metabolizers; in poor metabolizers, mean Cmax was up to 4 times higher and mean AUC was up to 12 times higher compared to extensive metabolizers. Though such study was not conducted in Caucasians and African Americans, it is expected dexlansoprazole exposure in these races will be affected by CYP2C19 phenotypes as well.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.4  Effect of Food on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics<BR>                     <BR>                        In food-effect studies in healthy subjects receiving KAPIDEX under various fed conditions compared to fasting, increases in Cmax ranged from 12% to 55%, increases in AUC ranged from 9% to 37%, and tmax varied (ranging from a decrease of 0.7 hours to an increase of 3 hours).  No significant differences in mean intragastric pH were observed between fasted and various fed conditions. However, the percentage of time intragastric pH exceeded 4 over the 24-hour dosing interval decreased slightly when KAPIDEX was administered after a meal (57%) relative to fasting (64%), primarily due to a decreased response in intragastric pH during the first 4 hours after dosing. Because of this, while KAPIDEX can be taken without regard to food, some patients may benefit from administering the dose prior to a meal if post-meal symptoms do not resolve under post-fed conditions.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.5	Special Populations<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Pediatric Use<BR>                              <BR>                              The pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole in patients under the age of 18 years have not been studied. <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Geriatric Use<BR>                              <BR>                              The terminal elimination half-life of dexlansoprazole is significantly increased in geriatric subjects compared to younger subjects (2.23 and 1.5 hours, respectively); this difference is not clinically relevant.  Dexlansoprazole exhibited higher systemic exposure (AUC) in geriatric subjects (34.5% higher) than younger subjects. No dosage adjustment is needed in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].  <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Renal Impairment<BR>                              <BR>                              Dexlansoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites, and no parent drug is recovered in the urine following an oral dose of dexlansoprazole. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole are not expected to be altered in patients with renal impairment, and no studies were conducted in subjects with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole were studied in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment; results demonstrated no need for a dose adjustment for this patient population.<BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Hepatic Impairment<BR>                              <BR>                              In a study of 12 patients with moderately impaired hepatic function who received a single oral dose of KAPIDEX 60 mg, plasma exposure (AUC) of bound and unbound dexlansoprazole in the hepatic impairment group was approximately 2 times greater compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. This difference in exposure was not due to a difference in protein binding between the two liver function groups. No adjustment for KAPIDEX is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). KAPIDEX 30 mg should be considered for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].<BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Gender<BR>                              <BR>                              In a study of 12 male and 12 female healthy subjects who received a single oral dose of KAPIDEX 60 mg, females had higher systemic exposure (AUC) (42.8% higher) than males.

As such, no clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. Furthermore, clinical drug-drug interaction studies in mainly CYP2C19 extensive and intermediate metabolizers have shown that KAPIDEX does not affect the pharmacokinetics of diazepam, phenytoin, or theophylline.
