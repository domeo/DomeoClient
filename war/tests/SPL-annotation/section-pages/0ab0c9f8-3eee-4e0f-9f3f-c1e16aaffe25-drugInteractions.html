Reduce KALYDECO dose to 150 mg once daily when co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole). Avoid food containing grapefruit or Seville oranges.

Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, significantly increased ivacaftor exposure [measured as area under the curve (AUC)] by 8.5-fold. Therefore, a reduction of the KALYDECO dose to 150 mg twice-a-week is recommended for co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, and clarithromycin.<BR>                        Co-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased ivacaftor exposure by 3-fold. Therefore, a reduction of the KALYDECO dose to 150 mg once daily is recommended for patients taking concomitant moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole and erythromycin.<BR>                        Co-administration of KALYDECO with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of ivacaftor. Therefore, food containing grapefruit or Seville oranges should be avoided during treatment with KALYDECO [see <BR>                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.2	Inducers of CYP3A<BR>                     <BR>                        Co-administration with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by approximately 9-fold. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's Wort is not recommended [see <BR>                              Warnings and Precautions (5.2)<BR>                            and <BR>                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           ].<BR>                        <BR>                           Potential for ivacaftor to affect other drugs<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.3	CYP3A and/or P-gp Substrates<BR>                     <BR>                        Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite have the potential to inhibit CYP3A and P-gp. Co-administration with midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased midazolam exposure 1.5-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of CYP3A by ivacaftor. Administration of KALYDECO may increase systemic exposure of drugs which are substrates of CYP3A and/or P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events. Therefore, caution is recommended when co-administering KALYDECO with CYP3A and/or P-gp substrates, such as digoxin, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus [see <BR>                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
