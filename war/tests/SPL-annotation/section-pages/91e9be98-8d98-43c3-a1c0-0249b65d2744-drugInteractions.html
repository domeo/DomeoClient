Coadministration of RIFATER, because it contains rifampin, with<BR>              drugs that undergo biotransformation through these metabolic pathways may<BR>              accelerate elimination. To maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels, dosages of<BR>              drugs metabolized by these enzymes may require adjustment when starting or<BR>              stopping concomitantly administered rifampin.<BR>            Rifampin has been reported to accelerate the metabolism of the following drugs:<BR>            anticonvulsants (eg, phenytoin), antiarrhythmics (eg, disopyramide, mexiletine,<BR>            quinidine, tocainide), anticoagulants, antifungals (eg, fluconazole,<BR>            itraconazole, ketoconazole), barbiturates, beta-blockers, calcium channel<BR>            blockers (eg, diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin,<BR>            corticosteroids, cyclosporine, cardiac glycoside preparations, clofibrate, oral<BR>            contraceptives, dapsone, diazepam, haloperidol, oral hypoglycemic agents<BR>            (sulfonylureas), methadone, narcotic analgesics, nortriptyline, progestins, and<BR>            theophylline. It may be necessary to adjust dosages of these drugs if they are<BR>            given concurrently with RIFATER since it contains rifampin.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Rifampin has been observed to increase the requirements for anticoagulant drugs<BR>            of the coumarin type. In patients receiving anticoagulants and RIFATER<BR>            concurrently, it is recommended that the prothrombin time be performed daily or<BR>            as frequently as necessary to establish and maintain the required dose of<BR>            anticoagulant.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Concurrent use of ketoconazole and rifampin has resulted in decreased serum<BR>            concentration of both drugs. Concurrent use of rifampin and enalapril has<BR>            resulted in decreased concentrations of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of<BR>            enalapril. Since RIFATER contains rifampin, dosage adjustments should be made if<BR>            RIFATER is concurrently administered with ketoconazole or enalapril if indicated<BR>            by the patient's clinical condition.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Other Interactions<BR>              Concomitant antacid administration may reduce the absorption of<BR>              rifampin. Daily doses of RIFATER, because it contains rifampin, should be given<BR>              at least 1 hour before the ingestion of antacids.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Probenecid and cotrimoxazole have been reported to increase the blood level<BR>              of rifampin.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              When rifampin is given concomitantly with either halothane or isoniazid the<BR>              potential for hepatotoxicity is increased. The concomitant use of RIFATER,<BR>              because it contains both rifampin and isoniazid, and halothane should be<BR>              avoided. Patients receiving both rifampin and isoniazid as in RIFATER should be<BR>              monitored closely for hepatotoxicity. See the boxed WARNING.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Plasma concentrations of sulfapyridine may be reduced following the<BR>              concomitant administration of sulfasalazine and RIFATER, because it contains<BR>              rifampin. This finding may be the result of alteration in the colonic bacteria<BR>              responsible for the reduction of sulfasalazine to sulfapyridine and<BR>              mesalamine. <BR><BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>              Isoniazid<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Enzyme Inhibition: Isoniazid is known to inhibit certain<BR>              cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Coadministration of isoniazid with drugs that undergo<BR>              biotransformation through these metabolic pathways may decrease elimination.<BR>              Consequently, dosages of drugs metabolized by these enzymes may require<BR>              adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly administered RIFATER, because<BR>              it contains isoniazid, to maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels.<BR>Isoniazid has been reported to inhibit the metabolism of the following drugs:<BR>              anticonvulsants (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid),<BR>              benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam), haloperidol, ketoconazole, theophylline, and<BR>              warfarin. It may be necessary to adjust the dosages of these drugs if they are<BR>              given concurrently with RIFATER because it contains isoniazid. The impact of the<BR>              competing effects of rifampin and isoniazid on the metabolism of these drugs is<BR>              unknown.<BR>            <BR>                  Other Interactions<BR>              Concomitant antacid administration may reduce the absorption of<BR>              isoniazid. Ingestion with food may also reduce the absorption of isoniazid.<BR>              Daily doses of RIFATER, because it contains isoniazid, should be given on an<BR>              empty stomach at least 1 hour before the ingestion of antacids or food.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Corticosteroids (eg, prednisolone) may decrease the serum concentration of<BR>              isoniazid by increasing acetylation rate and/or renal clearance.<BR>              Para-aminosalicylic acid may increase the plasma concentration and elimination<BR>              half-life of isoniazid by competition of acetylating enzymes.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>                  Pharmacodynamic Interactions<BR>              Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher<BR>              incidence of isoniazid hepatitis. Isoniazid, when given concomitantly with<BR>              rifampin, has been reported to increase the hepatotoxicity of both drugs.<BR>              Patients receiving both rifampin and isoniazid as in RIFATER should be monitored<BR>              closely for hepatotoxicity.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              The CNS effects of meperidine (drowsiness), cycloserine (dizziness,<BR>              drowsiness), and disulfiram (acute behavioral and coordination changes) may be<BR>              exaggerated when concomitant RIFATER, because it contains isoniazid, is given.<BR>              Concurrent RIFATER, because it contains isoniazid, and levodopa administration<BR>              may produce symptoms of excess catecholamine stimulation (agitation, flushing,<BR>              palpitations) or lack of levodopa effect.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Isoniazid may produce hyperglycemia and lead to loss of glucose control in<BR>              patients on oral hypoglycemics.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Fast acetylation of isoniazid may produce high concentrations of hydrazine<BR>              that facilitate deflorination of enflurane. Renal function should be monitored<BR>              in patients receiving both RIFATER and enflurane.<BR>            <BR>                  Food Interactions<BR>              Because isoniazid has some monoamine oxidase inhibiting activity,<BR>              an interaction with tyramine-containing foods (cheese, red wine) may occur.<BR>              Diamine oxidase may also be inhibited, causing exaggerated response (eg,<BR>              headache, sweating, palpitations, flushing, hypotension) to foods containing<BR>              histamine (eg, skipjack, tuna, other tropical fish). Tyramine- and<BR>              histamine-containing foods should be avoided by patients receiving RIFATER.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
