DESCRIPTION<BR>               <BR>                  Carvedilol is a nonselective β-adrenergic blocking agent with α1-blocking activity. It is (±)-1-(Carbazol-4-yloxy)-3-[[2-(o-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl]amino]-2-propanol. Carvedilol is a racemic mixture with the following structure: <BR>                  <BR>                  Carvedilol is a white to almost white crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 406.5 and a molecular formula of C24H26N2O4. It is freely soluble in dimethylsulfoxide; soluble in methylene chloride and methanol; sparingly soluble in 95% ethanol and isopropanol; slightly soluble in ethyl ether; and practically insoluble in water, gastric fluid (simulated, TS, pH 1.1), and intestinal fluid (simulated, TS without pancreatin, pH 7.5).<BR>                  Each carvedilol tablet intended for oral administration contains 3.125 mg or 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg or 25 mg of carvedilol. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, povidone, talc, and titanium dioxide.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
