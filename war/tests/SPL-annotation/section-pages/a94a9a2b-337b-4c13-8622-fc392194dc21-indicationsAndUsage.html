Both studies in treatment-experienced subjects were conducted in clinically advanced, 3-class antiretroviral-experienced (NRTI, NNRTI, PI, or enfuvirtide) adults with evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy. <BR>                  The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with SELZENTRY:<BR>                  <BR>                     Adult patients infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 should use SELZENTRY.<BR>                     Tropism testing must be conducted with a highly sensitive tropism assay that has demonstrated the ability to identify patients appropriate for SELZENTRY use. Outgrowth of pre-existing low-level CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic HIV-1 not detected by tropism testing at screening has been associated with virologic failure on SELZENTRY.
