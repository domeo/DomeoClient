Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. Animal studies indicate that after rapid disappearance from plasma, omeprazole can be found within the gastric mucosa for a day or more.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics<BR>                     <BR>                        Antisecretory Activity <BR>                        After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect of omeprazole occurs within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring within two hours. Inhibition of secretion is about 50% of maximum at 24 hours and the duration of inhibition lasts up to 72 hours. The antisecretory effect thus lasts far longer than would be expected from the very short (less than one hour) plasma half-life, apparently due to prolonged binding to the parietal H+/K+ ATPase enzyme. When the drug is discontinued, secretory activity returns gradually, over 3 to 5 days. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion increases with repeated once-daily dosing, reaching a plateau after four days.  <BR>                        Results from numerous studies of the antisecretory effect of multiple doses of 20 mg and 40 mg of omeprazole in normal volunteers and patients are shown below. The “max” value represents determinations at a time of maximum effect (2-6 hours after dosing), while “min” values are those 24 hours after the last dose of omeprazole.<BR>                        Table 1<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><BR>                           <caption>Range of Mean Values from Multiple Studies of the Mean Antisecretory Effects of Omeprazole After Multiple Daily Dosing</caption><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <thead><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <th valign="top"/><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" colspan="2"> Omeprazole 20 mg</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" colspan="2"> Omeprazole 40 mg</th><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Botrule     "> Parameter</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Botrule     "> Max</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Botrule     "> Min</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Botrule     "> Max</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Botrule     "> Min</th><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </thead><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>% Decrease in Basal Acid Output</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>78<footnote ID="FOOT_3720">Single Studies</footnote><BR>                                    </paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>58&#8211;80</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>94<footnoteRef IDREF="FOOT_3720"/><BR>                                    </paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>80&#8211;93</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>% Decrease in Peak Acid Output</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>79<footnoteRef IDREF="FOOT_3720"/><BR>                                    </paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>50&#8211;59</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>88<footnoteRef IDREF="FOOT_3720"/><BR>                                    </paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>62&#8211;68</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>% Decrease in 24&#8211;hr Intragastric Acidity</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>80&#8211;97</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>92&#8211;94</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR>Single daily oral doses of omeprazole ranging from a dose of 10 mg to 40 mg have produced 100% inhibition of 24-hour intragastric acidity in some patients.<BR>                        Serum Gastric Effects <BR>                        In studies involving more than 200 patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1 to 2 weeks of once-daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole in parallel with inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase in serum gastrin occurred with continued treatment. In comparison with histamine H2-receptor antagonists, the median increases produced by 20 mg doses of omeprazole were higher (1.3 to 3.6 fold vs. 1.1 to 1.8 fold increase). Gastrin values returned to pretreatment levels, usually within 1 to 2 weeks after discontinuation of therapy.<BR>                        <BR>         Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cell Effects <BR>                        Human gastric biopsy specimens have been obtained from more than 3000 patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical trials. The incidence of ECL cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia has been found in these patients. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12 ] However, these studies are of insufficient duration and size to rule out the possible influence of long-term administration of omeprazole on the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions.  <BR>                        <BR>         Other Effects <BR>                        Systemic effects of omeprazole in the CNS, cardiovascular and respiratory systems have not been found to date. Omeprazole, given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2 to 4 weeks, had no effect on thyroid function, carbohydrate metabolism, or circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin.  <BR>                        No effect on gastric emptying of the solid and liquid components of a test meal was demonstrated after a single dose of omeprazole 90 mg. In healthy subjects, a single I.V. dose of omeprazole (0.35 mg/kg) had no effect on intrinsic factor secretion. No systematic dose-dependent effect has been observed on basal or stimulated pepsin output in humans.  <BR>                        However, when intragastric pH is maintained at 4.0 or above, basal pepsin output is low, and pepsin activity is decreased.  <BR>                        As do other agents that elevate intragastric pH, omeprazole administered for 14 days in healthy subjects produced a significant increase in the intragastric concentrations of viable bacteria. The pattern of the bacterial species was unchanged from that commonly found in saliva. All changes resolved within three days of stopping treatment.  <BR>                        The course of Barrett’s esophagus in 106 patients was evaluated in a U.S. double-blind controlled study of omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for 12 months followed by 20 mg twice daily for 12 months or ranitidine 300 mg twice daily for 24 months. No clinically significant impact on Barrett’s mucosa by antisecretory therapy was observed. Although neosquamous epithelium developed during antisecretory therapy, complete elimination of Barrett’s mucosa was not achieved. No significant difference was observed between treatment groups in development of dysplasia in Barrett’s mucosa and no patient developed esophageal carcinoma during treatment. No significant differences between treatment groups were observed in development of ECL cell hyperplasia, corpus atrophic gastritis, corpus intestinal metaplasia, or colon polyps exceeding 3 mm in diameter [See Clinical Pharmacology (12)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>         Absorption <BR>                        Omeprazole delayed-release capsules contain an enteric-coated granule formulation of omeprazole (because omeprazole is acid-labile), so that absorption of omeprazole begins only after the granules leave the stomach. Absorption is rapid, with peak plasma levels of omeprazole occurring within 0.5 to 3.5 hours. Peak plasma concentrations of omeprazole and AUC are approximately proportional to doses up to 40 mg, but because of a saturable first-pass effect, a greater than linear response in peak plasma concentration and AUC occurs with doses greater than 40 mg. Absolute bioavailability (compared with intravenous administration) is about 30-40% at doses of 20-40 mg, due in large part to presystemic metabolism. In healthy subjects the plasma half-life is 0.5 to 1 hour, and the total body clearance is 500-600 mL/min.<BR>                        The bioavailability of omeprazole increases slightly upon repeated administration of omeprazole delayed-release capsules. <BR>                        Omeprazole delayed-release capsules 40 mg was bioequivalent when administered with and without applesauce. However, Omeprazole delayed-release capsules 20 mg was not bioequivalent when administered with and without applesauce. When administered with applesauce, a mean 25% reduction in Cmax was observed without a significant change in AUC for Omeprazole delayed-release capsules 20 mg. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. <BR>                        <BR>         Distribution <BR>                        Protein binding is approximately 95%.  <BR>                        <BR>         Metabolism <BR>                        Omeprazole is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system.  <BR>                        <BR>         Excretion <BR>                        Following single dose oral administration of a buffered solution of omeprazole, little if any unchanged drug was excreted in urine. The majority of the dose (about 77%) was eliminated in urine as at least six metabolites. Two were identified as hydroxyomeprazole and the corresponding carboxylic acid. The remainder of the dose was recoverable in feces. This implies a significant biliary excretion of the metabolites of omeprazole. Three metabolites have been identified in plasma — the sulfide and sulfone derivatives of omeprazole, and hydroxyomeprazole. These metabolites have very little or no antisecretory activity.  <BR>                        <BR>                           Combination Therapy with Antimicrobials<BR>                        <BR>                        Omeprazole 40 mg daily was given in combination with clarithromycin 500 mg every 8 hours to healthy adult male subjects. The steady state plasma concentrations of omeprazole were increased (Cmax, AUC0-24, and T1/2 increases of 30%, 89% and 34% respectively) by the concomitant administration of clarithromycin. The observed increases in omeprazole plasma concentration were associated with the following pharmacological effects. The mean 24-hour gastric pH value was 5.2 when omeprazole was administered alone and 5.7 when co-administered with clarithromycin.<BR>                        The plasma levels of clarithromycin and 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin were increased by the concomitant administration of omeprazole. For clarithromycin, the mean Cmax was 10% greater, the mean Cmin was 27% greater, and the mean AUC0-8  was 15% greater when clarithromycin was administered with omeprazole than when clarithromycin was administered alone. Similar results were seen for 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin, the mean Cmax was 45% greater, the mean Cmin was 57% greater, and the mean AUC0-8 was 45% greater. Clarithromycin concentrations in the gastric tissue and mucus were also increased by concomitant administration of omeprazole.<BR>                        <BR>                           Table 2<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><BR>                           <caption>Clarithromycin Tissue Concentrations 2 hours after Dose<sup>1</sup><BR>                           </caption><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <thead><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Botrule     "> Tissue</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Botrule     "> Clarithromycin</th><BR>                                 <th align="center" valign="top" styleCode="     Botrule     "> Clarithromycin + Omeprazole</th><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </thead><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>Antrum</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>10.48 &#177; 2.01 (n = 5)</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>19.96 &#177; 4.71   (n=5)</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>Fundus</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>20.81 &#177; 7.64 (n = 5)</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>24.25 &#177; 6.37 (n= 5)</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>Mucus</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>4.15 &#177; 7.74 (n = 4)</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>39.29 &#177; 32.79 (n=4)</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR><BR>                           1 mean ± SD (mcg/g)<BR>                        <BR>                           Special Populations<BR>                        <BR>                        Geriatric Population <BR>                        The elimination rate of omeprazole was somewhat decreased in the elderly, and bioavailability was increased.

Plasma clearance averaged 70 mL/min, compared with a value of 500-600 mL/min in normal subjects. Dose reduction, particularly where maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis is indicated, for the hepatically impaired should be considered. <BR>                        <BR>         Renal Impairment <BR>                         In patients with chronic renal impairment, whose creatinine clearance ranged between 10 and 62 mL/min/1.73 m2, the disposition of omeprazole was very similar to that in healthy volunteers, although there was a slight increase in bioavailability. Because urinary excretion is a primary route of excretion of omeprazole metabolites, their elimination slowed in proportion to the decreased creatinine clearance.

Therefore, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done, if possible. Patients with clarithromycin resistant H. pylori should not be treated with any of the following: omeprazole/clarithromycin dual therapy, omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin triple therapy, or other regimens which include clarithromycin as the sole antimicrobial agent.<BR>                        Amoxicillin Susceptibility Test Results and Clinical/Bacteriological Outcomes <BR>                        In the triple therapy clinical trials, 84.9% (157/185) of the patients in the omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin treatment group who had pretreatment amoxicillin susceptible MICs (≤ 0.25 mcg/mL) were eradicated of H. pylori and 15.1% (28/185) failed therapy. Of the 28 patients who failed triple therapy, 11 had no post-treatment susceptibility test results and 17 had post-treatment H. pylori isolates with amoxicillin susceptible MICs. Eleven of the patients who failed triple therapy also had post-treatment H. pylori isolates with clarithromycin resistant MICs.<BR>                        <BR>         Susceptibility Test for Helicobacter pylori <BR>                        <BR>                        The reference methodology for susceptibility testing of H. pylori is agar dilution MICs1. One to three microliters of an inoculum equivalent to a No. 2 McFarland standard (1 x 107 - 1 x 108 CFU/mL for H. pylori) are inoculated directly onto freshly prepared antimicrobial containing Mueller-Hinton agar plates with 5% aged defibrinated sheep blood (≥ 2 weeks old). The agar dilution plates are incubated at 35°C in a microaerobic environment produced by a gas generating system suitable for campylobacters. After 3 days of incubation, the MICs are recorded as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent required to inhibit growth of the organism. The clarithromycin and amoxicillin MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:<BR>                        Table 5<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>Clarithromycin MIC (mcg/mL)<content styleCode="italics"><BR>                                          <sup>a</sup><BR>                                       </content><BR>                                    </paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>Interpretation</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>&#8804; 0.25</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>Susceptible (S)</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>0.5</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>Intermediate (I)</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>&gt; 1.0</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>Resistant (R)</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td valign="top">&#160;</td><BR>                                 <td valign="top">&#160;</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>Amoxicillin MIC (mcg/mL)<content styleCode="italics"><BR>                                          <sup>a,</sup><BR>                                          <sup>b</sup><BR>                                       </content><BR>                                    </paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>Interpretation</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>&#8804; 0.25</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td valign="top">&#160;<paragraph>Susceptible (S)</paragraph><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR><BR>                           <BR>                              a<BR>                           These are tentative breakpoints for the agar dilution methodology and they should not be used to interpret results obtained using alternative methods.           <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              b<BR>                           There were not enough organisms with MICs > 0.25 mcg/mL to determine a resistance breakpoint. <BR>                        Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures.
