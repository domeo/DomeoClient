It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects.<BR>                        Given the likelihood that a substantial proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               </P></DIV></HTML>
