Optimal Anticoagulation<BR>                     <BR>                        Warfarin sodium is a narrow therapeutic range (index) drug, and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during warfarin sodium therapy. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with warfarin sodium, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see <BR>                              Dosage and Administration (2.8)<BR>                            and <BR>                              Drug Interactions (7)<BR>                           ].<BR>                        Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of warfarin sodium therapy.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.5 Missed Dose<BR>                     <BR>                        The anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of warfarin sodium at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.7 Treatment During Dentistry and Surgery<BR>                     <BR>                        Some dental or surgical procedures may necessitate the interruption or change in the dose of warfarin sodium therapy. Consider the benefits and risks when discontinuing warfarin sodium even for a short period of time. Determine the INR immediately prior to any dental or surgical procedure. In patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to, during, or immediately following these procedures, adjusting the dosage of warfarin sodium to maintain the INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.8 Conversion From Other Anticoagulants<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Heparin<BR>                              <BR>                              Since the full anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium is not achieved for several days, heparin is preferred for initial rapid anticoagulation. During initial therapy with warfarin sodium, the interference with heparin anticoagulation is of minimal clinical significance. Conversion to warfarin sodium may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 6 days. To ensure therapeutic anticoagulation, continue full dose heparin therapy and overlap warfarin sodium therapy with heparin for 4 to 5 days and until warfarin sodium has produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by INR, at which point heparin may be discontinued.<BR>                              As heparin may affect the INR, patients receiving both heparin and warfarin sodium should have INR monitoring at least:<BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                    •5 hours after the last intravenous bolus dose of heparin, or<BR>                                 <BR>                                    •4 hours after cessation of a continuous intravenous infusion of heparin, or<BR>                                 <BR>                                    •24 hours after the last subcutaneous heparin injection.<BR>                              <BR>                              Warfarin sodium may increase the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test, even in the absence of heparin.
