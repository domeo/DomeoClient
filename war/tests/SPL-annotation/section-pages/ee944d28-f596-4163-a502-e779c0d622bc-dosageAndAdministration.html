However, failing this in adults, an initial double (loading) dose of 1 g (= 600 mg base), or in children 10 mg base/kg may be taken in two divided doses, six hours apart. The suppressive therapy should be continued for eight weeks after leaving the endemic area.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     For Treatment of Acute Attack<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Adults: <BR>                           <BR> An initial dose of 1 g (= 600 mg base) followed by an additional 500 mg (= 300 mg base)<BR>after six to eight hours and a single dose of 500 mg (= 300 mg base) on each of two consecutive<BR>days.
