Suicide is a known risk of <BR>depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders <BR>themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a <BR>long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing <BR>worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients <BR>during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term <BR>placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that <BR>these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in <BR>children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive <BR>disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show <BR>an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo <BR>in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to <BR>placebo in adults aged 65 and older.<BR>                  The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents <BR>with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders <BR>included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 <BR>patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or <BR>other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median <BR>duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There <BR>was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency <BR>toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There <BR>were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different <BR>indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. <BR>placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across <BR>indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of <BR>cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.                                                                  Table 1<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ID="i44e11d96-5eea-4ef0-86de-bd3f6cb61e0c" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="608"><BR>                     <col width="227"/><BR>                     <col width="381"/><BR>                     <tbody><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Age<BR>  Range<content><BR>                                    <content><BR>                                       <br/><BR>                                    </content><BR>                                 </content><BR>                              </content><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Drug-Placebo Difference in<BR>  Number of Cases of Suicidality Per 1,000 Patients Treated<content><BR>                                    <content><BR>                                       <br/><BR>                                    </content><BR>                                 </content><BR>                              </content><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <br/><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <content styleCode="underline"><BR>                                 <content styleCode="bold"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">I<content styleCode="bold"><BR>                                          <content styleCode="underline"><BR>                                             <content styleCode="bold">ncreases Compared to Placebo</content><BR>                                          </content><BR>                                          <content styleCode="bold"><BR>                                             <content><BR>                                                <content><BR>                                                   <br/><BR>                                                </content><BR>                                             </content><BR>                                          </content><BR>                                       </content><BR>                                    </content><BR>                                 </content><BR>                              </content><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; less than 18<content>&#160;</content><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td>14 additional cases</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 18 to 24<content>&#160;&#160;</content><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td>5 additional cases</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <br/><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <content styleCode="underline"><BR>                                 <content styleCode="bold">Decreases Compared to Placebo</content><BR>                                 <content styleCode="bold"><BR>                                    <content/><BR>                                 </content><BR>                              </content><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 25 to 64<content>&#160;&#160;</content><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td>1 fewer case</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8805; 65</td><BR>                           <td>6 fewer cases</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                     </tbody><BR>                  </table>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in <BR>the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion <BR>about drug effect on suicide.<BR><BR><BR>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., <BR>beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from <BR>placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of <BR>antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.<BR>                  <BR>                     All patients being treated with antidepressants for any <BR>indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical <BR>worsening, suicidality and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the <BR>initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, <BR>either increases or decreases.<BR>                  <BR>                  The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, <BR>irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor <BR>restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric <BR>patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as <BR>well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a <BR>causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of <BR>depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, <BR>there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging <BR>suicidality.<BR>                  Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including <BR>possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is <BR>persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms <BR>that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if <BR>these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's <BR>presenting symptoms.<BR>                  <BR>                     Families and caregivers of patients being treated with <BR>antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both <BR>psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor <BR>patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in <BR>behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of <BR>suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. <BR>Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and <BR>caregivers. Prescriptions for doxepin should be written for the smallest <BR>number of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce <BR>the risk of overdose.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder<BR>                  A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of <BR>bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled <BR>trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase <BR>the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for <BR>bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a <BR>conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an <BR>antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened <BR>to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should <BR>include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, <BR>bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that doxepin is not <BR>approved for use in treating bipolar depression.<BR>                  It should be noted that doxepin is not approved for use in treating any <BR>indications in the pediatric population.<BR>                  The once a day dosage regimen of doxepin in patients with intercurrent <BR>illness or patients taking other medications should be carefully adjusted.
