Incidence of CTC grade 3 or 4 abnormalities was low (approximately 0.1%) in both treatment groups. Approximately 20% of patients receiving EXEMESTANE in clinical studies in advanced breast cancer experienced CTC grade 3 or 4 lymphocytopenia. Of these patients, 89% had a pre-existing lower grade lymphopenia. Forty percent of patients either recovered or improved to a lesser severity while on treatment. Patients did not have a significant increase in viral infections, and no opportunistic infections were observed. Elevations of serum levels of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transferase > 5 times the upper value of the normal range (i.e., ≥ CTC grade 3) have been rarely reported in patients treated for advanced breast cancer but appear mostly attributable to the underlying presence of liver and/or bone metastases. In the comparative study in advanced breast cancer patients, CTC grade 3 or 4 elevation of gamma glutamyl transferase without documented evidence of liver metastasis was reported in 2.7% of patients treated with EXEMESTANE and in 1.8% of patients treated with megestrol acetate.<BR>                        In patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving EXEMESTANE than either tamoxifen or placebo. Treatment-emergent bilirubin elevations (any CTC grade) occurred in 5.3% of EXEMESTANE patients and 0.8% of tamoxifen patients on the Intergroup EXEMESTANE Study (IES), and in 6.9% of EXEMESTANE treated patients vs. 0% of placebo treated patients in the 027 study. CTC grade 3–4 increases in bilirubin occurred in 0.9% of EXEMESTANE treated patients compared to 0.1% of tamoxifen treated patients. Alkaline phosphatase elevations of any CTC grade occurred in 15.0% of EXEMESTANE treated patients on the IES compared to 2.6% of tamoxifen treated patients, and in 13.7% of EXEMESTANE treated patients compared to 6.9% of placebo treated patients in study 027. Creatinine elevations occurred in 5.8% of EXEMESTANE treated patients and 4.3% of tamoxifen treated patients on the IES and in 5.5% of EXEMESTANE treated patients and 0% of placebo treated patients in study 027.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.3	Reductions in Bone Mineral Density (BMD)<BR>                     <BR>                        Reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) over time are seen with EXEMESTANE use. Table 1 describes changes in BMD from baseline to 24 months in patients receiving EXEMESTANE compared to patients receiving tamoxifen (IES) or placebo (027).
