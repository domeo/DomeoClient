The interindividual variability of voriconazole pharmacokinetics is high. Greater than proportional increase in exposure is observed with increasing dose. It is estimated that, on average, increasing the oral dose in healthy subjects from 200 mg q12h to 300 mg q12h leads to a 2.5-fold increase in exposure (AUCÏ„), while increasing the intravenous dose from 3 mg/kg q12h to 4 mg/kg q12h produces a 2.3-fold increase in exposure (Table 8).<BR>                              <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" border="single" width="733.000" ID="id_c4857eaa-7396-42b6-a5e7-57acf10d4b78"><BR>                                 <caption ID="id_2aba7d7e-fed0-4466-9edb-849f1e3472c0">Table 8.

Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled data in healthy subjects (n = 207), the oral bioavailability of voriconazole is estimated to be 96% (CV 13%). Bioequivalence was established between the 200 mg tablet and the 40 mg/mL oral suspension when administered as a 400 mg q12h loading dose followed by a 200 mg q12h maintenance dose.<BR>                                    Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are achieved 1 to 2 hours after dosing. When multiple doses of voriconazole are administered with high-fat meals, the mean Cmax and AUCÏ„ are reduced by 34% and 24%, respectively when administered as a tablet and by 58% and 37% respectively when administered as the oral suspension [see Dosage and Administration (2)<BR>                                       ].<BR>                                    In healthy subjects, the absorption of voriconazole is not affected by coadministration of oral ranitidine, cimetidine or omeprazole, drugs that are known to increase gastric pH.<BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 Distribution<BR>                                 <BR>                                    The volume of distribution at steady-state for voriconazole is estimated to be 4.6 L/kg, suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Plasma protein binding is estimated to be 58% and was shown to be independent of plasma concentrations achieved following single and multiple oral doses of 200 mg or 300 mg (approximate range: 0.9 to 15 mcg/mL). Varying degrees of hepatic and renal insufficiency do not affect the protein binding of voriconazole.<BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 Metabolism<BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       In vitro studies showed that voriconazole is metabolized by the human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 [see Drug Interactions (7)<BR>                                       ].<BR>                                    <BR>                                       In vivo studies indicated that CYP2C19 is significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole. This enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism. For example, 15% to 20% of Asian populations may be expected to be poor metabolizers. For Caucasians and Blacks, the prevalence of poor metabolizers is 3% to 5%. Studies conducted in Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects have shown that poor metabolizers have, on average, 4-fold higher voriconazole exposure (AUCÏ„) than their homozygous extensive metabolizer counterparts. Subjects who are heterozygous extensive metabolizers have, on average, 2-fold higher voriconazole exposure than their homozygous extensive metabolizer counterparts.<BR>                                    The major metabolite of voriconazole is the N-oxide, which accounts for 72% of the circulating radiolabelled metabolites in plasma. Since this metabolite has minimal antifungal activity, it does not contribute to the overall efficacy of voriconazole.<BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 Excretion<BR>                                 <BR>                                    Voriconazole is eliminated via hepatic metabolism with less than 2% of the dose excreted unchanged in the urine. After administration of a single radiolabelled dose of either oral or IV voriconazole, preceded by multiple oral or IV dosing, approximately 80% to 83% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine. The majority (> 94%) of the total radioactivity is excreted in the first 96 hours after both oral and intravenous dosing.<BR>                                    As a result of nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the terminal half-life of voriconazole is dose dependent and therefore not useful in predicting the accumulation or elimination of voriconazole. <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Relationships<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 Clinical Efficacy and Safety<BR>                                 <BR>                                    In ten clinical trials, the median values for the average and maximum voriconazole plasma concentrations in individual patients across these studies (n = 1,121) was 2.51 mcg/mL (inter-quartile range 1.21 to 4.44 mcg/mL) and 3.79 mcg/mL (inter-quartile range 2.06 to 6.31 mcg/mL), respectively. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of patient data from six of these ten clinical trials (n = 280) could not detect a positive association between mean, maximum or minimum plasma voriconazole concentration and efficacy. However, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses of the data from all ten clinical trials identified positive associations between plasma voriconazole concentrations and rate of both liver function test abnormalities and visual disturbances [see Adverse Reactions (6)<BR>                                       ].<BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 Electrocardiogram<BR>                                 <BR>                                    A placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study to evaluate the effect on the QT interval of healthy male and female subjects was conducted with three single oral doses of voriconazole and ketoconazole. Serial ECGs and plasma samples were obtained at specified intervals over a 24 hour post-dose observation period. The placebo-adjusted mean maximum increases in QTc from baseline after 800 mg, 1200 mg and 1600 mg of voriconazole and after ketoconazole 800 mg were all < 10 msec. Females exhibited a greater increase in QTc than males, although all mean changes were < 10 msec. Age was not found to affect the magnitude of increase in QTc. No subject in any group had an increase in QTc of â‰¥ 60 msec from baseline. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec. However, the QT effect of voriconazole combined with drugs known to prolong the QT interval is unknown [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)<BR>                                       ].<BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 Gender<BR>                                 <BR>                                    In a multiple oral dose study, the mean Cmax and AUCÏ„ for healthy young females were 83% and 113% higher, respectively, than in healthy young males (18 to 45 years), after tablet dosing. In the same study, no significant differences in the mean Cmax and AUCÏ„ were observed between healthy elderly males and healthy elderly females (> 65 years).

Close monitoring for adverse events related to voriconazole is recommended if voriconazole is used sequentially after fluconazole, especially within 24 hours of the last dose of fluconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                                             ].<BR>                                          <BR>                                             <BR>                                                Minor or no significant pharmacokinetic interactions that do not require dosage adjustment:<BR>                                             <BR>                                          <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Cimetidine (non-specific CYP450 inhibitor and increases gastric pH)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          Cimetidine (400 mg q12h x 8 days) increased voriconazole steady-state Cmax and AUCÏ„ by an average of 18% (90% CI: 6%, 32%) and 23% (90% CI: 13%, 33%), respectively, following oral doses of 200 mg q12h x 7 days to healthy subjects.<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Ranitidine (increases gastric pH)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          Ranitidine (150 mg q12h) had no significant effect on voriconazole Cmax and AUCÏ„ following oral doses of 200 mg q12h x 7 days to healthy subjects.<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Macrolide antibiotics<BR>                                       <BR>                                          Coadministration of erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitor; 1 g q12h for 7 days) or azithromycin (500 mg qd for 3 days) with voriconazole 200 mg q12h for 14 days had no significant effect on voriconazole steady-state Cmax and AUCÏ„ in healthy subjects.

In these studies, the inhibition potency of voriconazole for CYP3A4 metabolic activity was significantly less than that of two other azoles, ketoconazole and itraconazole. In vitro studies also show that the major metabolite of voriconazole, voriconazole N-oxide, inhibits the metabolic activity of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to a greater extent than that of CYP2C19. Therefore, there is potential for voriconazole and its major metabolite to increase the systemic exposure (plasma concentrations) of other drugs metabolized by these CYP450 enzymes.<BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                          The systemic exposure of the following drugs is significantly increased or is expected to be significantly increased by coadministration of voriconazole and their use is contraindicated:<BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Sirolimus (CYP3A4 substrate)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          Repeat dose administration of oral voriconazole (400 mg q12h for 1 day, then 200 mg q12h for 8 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) an average of 7-fold (90% CI: 5.7, 7.5) and 11-fold (90% CI: 9.9, 12.6), respectively, in healthy male subjects.

An increase in the incidence of delayed and persistent alfentanil-associated nausea and vomiting during coadministration of voriconazole and alfentanil was also observed. Reduction in the dose of alfentanil or other opiates that are also metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) and extended close monitoring of patients for respiratory and other opiate-associated adverse events, may be necessary when any of these opiates is coadministered with voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                                             ].<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Fentanyl (CYP3A4 substrate)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          In an independent published study, concomitant use of voriconazole (400 mg q12h on Day 1, then 200 mg q12h on Day 2) with a single intravenous dose of fentanyl (5 mcg/kg) resulted in an increase in the mean AUC0-âˆž of fentanyl by 1.4-fold (range 0.81- to 2.04-fold). When voriconazole is coadministered with fentanyl IV, oral or transdermal dosage forms, extended and frequent monitoring of patients for respiratory depression and other fentanyl-associated adverse events is recommended and fentanyl dosage should be reduced if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                                             ].<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Oxycodone (CYP3A4 substrate)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          In an independent published study, coadministration of multiple doses of oral voriconazole (400 mg q12h, on Day 1 followed by five doses of 200 mg q12h on Days 2 to 4) with a single 10 mg oral dose of oxycodone on Day 3 resulted in an increase in the mean Cmax and AUC0â€“âˆž of oxycodone by 1.7- fold (range 1.4- to 2.2-fold) and 3.6-fold (range 2.7- to 5.6-fold), respectively. The mean elimination half-life of oxycodone was also increased by 2-fold (range 1.4- to 2.5-fold). Voriconazole also increased the visual effects (heterophoria and miosis) of oxycodone. A reduction in oxycodone dosage may be needed during voriconazole treatment to avoid opioid related adverse effects. Extended and frequent monitoring for adverse effects associated with oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                                             ].<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Cyclosporine (CYP3A4 substrate)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          In stable renal transplant recipients receiving chronic cyclosporine therapy, concomitant administration of oral voriconazole (200 mg q12h for 8 days) increased cyclosporine Cmax and AUCÏ„ an average of 1.1 times (90% CI: 0.9, 1.41) and 1.7 times (90% CI: 1.5, 2), respectively, as compared to when cyclosporine was administered without voriconazole. When initiating therapy with voriconazole in patients already receiving cyclosporine, it is recommended that the cyclosporine dose be reduced to one-half of the original dose and followed with frequent monitoring of the cyclosporine blood levels. Increased cyclosporine levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, cyclosporine levels should be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                                             ].<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Methadone (CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 substrate)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          Repeat dose administration of oral voriconazole (400mg q12h for 1 day, then 200mg q12h for 4 days) increased the Cmax and AUCÏ„ of pharmacologically active R-methadone by 31% (90% CI: 22%, 40%) and 47% (90% CI: 38%, 57%), respectively, in subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (30 mg to 100 mg QD). The Cmax and AUC of (S)-methadone increased by 65% (90% CI: 53%, 79%) and 103% (90% CI: 85%, 124%), respectively. Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                                             ].<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Tacrolimus (CYP3A4 substrate)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          Repeat oral dose administration of voriconazole (400 mg q12h x 1 day, then 200 mg q12h x 6 days) increased tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg single dose) Cmax and AUCÏ„ in healthy subjects by an average of 2-fold (90% CI: 1.9, 2.5) and 3-fold (90% CI: 2.7, 3.8), respectively. When initiating therapy with voriconazole in patients already receiving tacrolimus, it is recommended that the tacrolimus dose be reduced to one-third of the original dose and followed with frequent monitoring of the tacrolimus blood levels. Increased tacrolimus levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, tacrolimus levels should be carefully monitored and the dose increased as necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                                             ].<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          Coadministration of voriconazole (300 mg q12h x 12 days) with warfarin (30 mg single dose) significantly increased maximum prothrombin time by approximately 2 times that of placebo in healthy subjects. Close monitoring of prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation tests is recommended if warfarin and voriconazole are coadministered and the warfarin dose adjusted accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                                             ].<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Oral Coumarin Anticoagulants (CYP2C9, CYP3A4 substrates)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          Although not studied in vitro or in vivo, voriconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of coumarin anticoagulants and therefore may cause an increase in prothrombin time. If patients receiving coumarin preparations are treated simultaneously with voriconazole, the prothrombin time or other suitable anti-coagulation tests should be monitored at close intervals and the dosage of anticoagulants adjusted accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                                             ].<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Statins (CYP3A4 substrates)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          Although not studied clinically, voriconazole has been shown to inhibit lovastatin metabolism in vitro (human liver microsomes). Therefore, voriconazole is likely to increase the plasma concentrations of statins that are metabolized by CYP3A4. It is recommended that dose adjustment of the statin be considered during coadministration. Increased statin concentrations in plasma have been associated with rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                                             ].<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Benzodiazepines (CYP3A4 substrates)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          Although not studied clinically, voriconazole has been shown to inhibit midazolam metabolism in vitro (human liver microsomes). Therefore, voriconazole is likely to increase the plasma concentrations of benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., midazolam, triazolam, and alprazolam) and lead to a prolonged sedative effect. It is recommended that dose adjustment of the benzodiazepine be considered during coadministration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                                             ].<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       Calcium Channel Blockers (CYP3A4 substrates)<BR>                                       <BR>                                          Although not studied clinically, voriconazole has been shown to inhibit felodipine metabolism in vitro (human liver microsomes).
