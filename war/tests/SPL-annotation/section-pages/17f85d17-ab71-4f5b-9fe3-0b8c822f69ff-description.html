Pertuzumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture containing the antibiotic, gentamicin.  Gentamicin is not detectable in the final product.  Pertuzumab has an approximate molecular weight of 148 kDa.<BR>                  PERJETA is a sterile, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale brown liquid for intravenous infusion.  Each single use vial contains 420 mg of pertuzumab at a concentration of 30 mg/mL in 20 mM L-histidine acetate (pH 6.0), 120 mM sucrose and 0.02% polysorbate 20.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
