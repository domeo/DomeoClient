Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Therefore, fluoxetine should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within a minimum of 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI. Since fluoxetine and its major metabolite have very long elimination half-lives, at least 5 weeks [perhaps longer, especially if fluoxetine has been prescribed chronically and/or at higher doses (see Accumulation and Slow Elimination under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY)] should be allowed after stopping fluoxetine before starting an MAOI.Accumulation and Slow Elimination under <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Pimozide<BR>Concomitant use in patients taking pimozide is contraindicated.
