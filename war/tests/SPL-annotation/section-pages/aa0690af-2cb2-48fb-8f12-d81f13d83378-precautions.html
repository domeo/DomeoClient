It should be made clear that, in some instances, visual disturbances may be prolonged and, possibly, irreversible. Warn that visual symptoms may render such activities as driving a car or operating machinery more hazardous than usual, particularly under conditions of variable lighting (see WARNINGS).<BR>                  The patient should be instructed to inform the physician whenever any unusual visual symptoms occur.  If the patient has any visual symptoms, treatment should be discontinued and complete ophthalmologic evaluation performed.<BR>                  <BR>                     Abdominal/Pelvic Pain or Distention:  Ovarian enlargement may occur during or shortly after therapy with clomiPHENE citrate.  To minimize the risks associated with ovarian enlargement, the patient should be instructed to inform the physician of any abdominal or pelvic pain, weight gain, discomfort, or distention after taking clomiPHENE citrate (see WARNINGS).<BR>                  <BR>                     Multiple Pregnancy:  Inform the patient that there is an increased chance of multiple pregnancy, including bilateral tubal pregnancy and coexisting tubal and intrauterine pregnancy, when conception occurs in relation to clomiPHENE citrate therapy.  The potential complications and hazards of multiple pregnancy should be explained.<BR>                  <BR>                     Pregnancy Wastage and Birth Anomalies:  The physician should explain the assumed risk of any pregnancy, whether ovulation is induced with the aid of clomiPHENE citrate or occurs naturally.  The patient should be informed of the greater risks associated with certain characteristics or conditions of any pregnant woman, eg, age of female and male partner, history of spontaneous abortions, Rh genotype, abnormal menstrual history, infertility history, organic heart disease, diabetes, exposure to infectious agents such as rubella, familial history of birth anomaly, that may be pertinent to the patient for whom clomiPHENE citrate is being considered.  Based upon the evaluation of the patient, genetic counseling may be indicated.<BR>                  The overall incidence of reported birth anomalies from pregnancies associated with maternal clomiPHENE citrate ingestion during the investigational studies was within the range of that reported in published references for the general population.  (See CONTRAINDICATIONS: Pregnancy.)<BR>                  During clinical investigation, the experience from patients with known pregnancy outcome (Table 1) show a spontaneous abortion rate of 20.4% and stillbirth rate of 1.0%.  (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY)<BR>                  <BR>                     Drug Interactions<BR>                  <BR>                  Drug interactions with clomiPHENE citrate have not been documented.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility<BR><BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Long-term toxicity studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of clomiPHENE citrate.<BR>                        Oral administration of clomiPHENE citrate to male rats at doses of 0.3 or 1 mg/kg/day caused decreased fertility, while higher doses caused temporary infertility.  Oral doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day in female rats temporarily interrupted the normal cyclic vaginal smear pattern and prevented conception.  Doses of 0.3 mg/kg/day slightly reduced the number of ovulated ova and corpora lutea, while 3 mg/kg/day inhibited ovulation.<BR>                        <BR>                           Pregnancy<BR>                        <BR>                        Pregnancy Category X.
