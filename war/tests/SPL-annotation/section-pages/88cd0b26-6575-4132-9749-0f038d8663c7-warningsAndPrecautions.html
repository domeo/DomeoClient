Most cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used Carisoprodol Tablets in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been post-marketing adverse event reports of Carisoprodol Tablets-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of Carisoprodol Tablets dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, Carisoprodol Tablets should be used with caution in addiction-prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and Carisoprodol Tablets should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort.<BR>                        Carisoprodol Tablets and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may cause dependence [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY <BR>                           12.3) ]. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        5.3 Seizures<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received Carisoprodol Tablets.  Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [see OVERDOSAGE<BR>                           <BR>                              (10)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
