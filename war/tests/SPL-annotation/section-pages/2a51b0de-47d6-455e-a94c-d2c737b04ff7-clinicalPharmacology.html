Translocations can affect the ALK gene resulting in the expression of oncogenic fusion proteins. The formation of ALK fusion proteins results in activation and dysregulation of the gene's expression and signaling which can contribute to increased cell proliferation and survival in tumors expressing these proteins. Crizotinib demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of ALK and c-Met phosphorylation in cell-based assays using tumor cell lines and demonstrated antitumor activity in mice bearing tumor xenografts that expressed EML4- or NPM-ALK fusion proteins or c-Met.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Absorption<BR>                              <BR>                              Following oral single-dose administration, crizotinib was absorbed with median time to achieve peak concentration of 4 to 6 hours. Following crizotinib 250 mg twice daily, steady state was reached within 15 days and remained stable, with a median accumulation ratio of 4.8. Steady state systemic exposure (Cmin and AUC) appeared to increase in a greater than dose proportional manner over the dose range of 200â€“300 mg twice daily.<BR>                              The mean absolute bioavailability of crizotinib was 43% (range: 32% to 66%) following the administration of a single 250 mg oral dose.<BR>                              A high-fat meal reduced crizotinib AUCinf and Cmax by approximately 14%.

In Study B, steady-state trough concentrations in patients with mild (CLcr 60 to 90 mL/min, N=47) and moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 60 mL/min, N=27) were similar to those in patients with normal renal function (CLcr greater than 90 mL/min, N=33). Limited data (N=1) are available in patients with severe renal impairment, and no data are available in patients with end-stage renal disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       Ethnicity:  After 250 mg twice daily dosing, steady-state crizotinib Cmax and AUCÏ„ in Asian patients were 1.57- and 1.50-fold those seen in non-Asian patients, respectively.<BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.4 Cardiac Electrophysiology<BR>                     <BR>                        The QT interval prolongation potential of crizotinib was assessed in all patients who received XALKORI 250 mg twice daily. Serial ECGs in triplicate were collected following a single dose and at steady state to evaluate the effect of crizotinib on QT intervals. Four of 308 patients (1.3%) were found to have QTcF (corrected QT by the Fridericia method) greater than or equal to 500 msec, and 10 of 289 patients (3.5%) had an increase from baseline QTcF greater than or equal to 60 msec by automated machine-read evaluation of ECG. A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis suggested a concentration-dependent increase in QTcF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
