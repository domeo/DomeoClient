The serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine clearance, and magnesium, sodium, potassium, and calcium levels should be measured prior to initiating therapy, and prior to each subsequent course. At the recommended dosage, PLATINOL should not be given more frequently than once every 3 to 4 weeks (see <BR>                        ADVERSE REACTIONS<BR>                     ). Elderly patients may be more susceptible to nephrotoxicity (see <BR>                        PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use<BR>                     ).<BR>                  There are reports of severe neuropathies in patients in whom regimens are employed using higher doses of PLATINOL or greater dose frequencies than those recommended. These neuropathies may be irreversible and are seen as paresthesias in a stocking-glove distribution, areflexia, and loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to peripheral neuropathy (see <BR>                        PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use<BR>                     ).<BR>                  Loss of motor function has also been reported.<BR>                  Anaphylactic-like reactions to PLATINOL have been reported. These reactions have occurred within minutes of administration to patients with prior exposure to PLATINOL, and have been alleviated by administration of epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines.<BR>                  Since ototoxicity of PLATINOL is cumulative, audiometric testing should be performed prior to initiating therapy and prior to each subsequent dose of drug (see <BR>                        ADVERSE REACTIONS<BR>                     ).<BR>                  PLATINOL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. PLATINOL is mutagenic in bacteria and produces chromosome aberrations in animal cells in tissue culture. In mice PLATINOL is teratogenic and embryotoxic. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.<BR>                  The carcinogenic effect of PLATINOL was studied in BD IX rats. PLATINOL was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to 50 BD IX rats for 3 weeks, 3 X 1 mg/kg body weight per week. Four hundred and fifty-five days after the first application, 33 animals died, 13 of them related to malignancies: 12 leukemias and 1 renal fibrosarcoma.<BR>                  The development of acute leukemia coincident with the use of PLATINOL has been reported. In these reports, PLATINOL was generally given in combination with other leukemogenic agents.<BR>                  Injection site reactions may occur during the administration of PLATINOL (see <BR>                        ADVERSE REACTIONS<BR>                     ). Given the possibility of extravasation, it is recommended to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration. A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
