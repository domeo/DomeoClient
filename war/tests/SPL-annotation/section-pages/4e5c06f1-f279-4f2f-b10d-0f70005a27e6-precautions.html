Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.<BR>                        The pharmacological activity of flurbiprofen tablets in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Hepatic Effects<BR>                     <BR>                        Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including flurbiprofen tablets. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice, fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.<BR>                        A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or with abnormal liver test values, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with flurbiprofen tablets. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), flurbiprofen tablets should be discontinued.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Hematological Effects<BR>                     <BR>                        Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including flurbiprofen tablets. This may be due to fluid retention, GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including flurbiprofen tablets, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked periodically even if they do not exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.<BR>                        Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Flurbiprofen tablets do not generally affect platelet counts, prothrombin time (PT), or partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Patients receiving flurbiprofen tablets who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Preexisting Asthma<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, flurbiprofen tablets should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Vision Changes<BR>                     <BR>                        Blurred and/or diminished vision has been reported with the use of flurbiprofen tablets and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients experiencing eye complaints should have ophthalmologic examinations.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Information for Patients<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.<BR>                        <BR>                           Flurbiprofen tablets, like other NSAIDs, may cause CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Effects).<BR>                           Flurbiprofen tablets, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).<BR>                           Flurbiprofen tablets, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS and TEN, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.<BR>                           Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians.<BR>                           Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.<BR>                           Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid Reactions).<BR>                           In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, flurbiprofen tablets should be avoided because they may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Laboratory Tests<BR>                     <BR>                        Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should have their CBC and chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash etc.) or abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, flurbiprofen tablets should be discontinued.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Drug Interactions<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           ACE-Inhibitors<BR>                           <BR>                              Reports suggest that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Anticoagulants<BR>                           <BR>                              The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone. The physician should be cautious when administering flurbiprofen tablets to patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Aspirin<BR>                           <BR>                              Concurrent administration of aspirin lowers serum flurbiprofen concentrations (see CLINICAL <BR>                                 PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug Interactions). The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of flurbiprofen and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Beta-Andrenergic Blocking Agents<BR>                           <BR>                              Flurbiprofen attenuated the hypotensive effect of propranolol but not atenolol (see CLINICAL <BR>                                 PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug Interactions). The mechanism underlying this interference is unknown. Patients taking both flurbiprofen and a beta-blocker should be monitored to ensure that a satisfactory hypotensive effect is achieved.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Diuretics<BR>                           <BR>                              Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that flurbiprofen tablets can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects), as well as diuretic efficacy.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Lithium<BR>                           <BR>                              NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%.<BR>                              These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Thus, when non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Methotrexate<BR>                           <BR>                              Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate.

Because of possible adverse effects of prostaglandin-inhibiting drugs on neonates, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        As with any NSAID, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older).<BR>                        Clinical experience with flurbiprofen suggests that elderly patients may have a higher incidence of gastrointestinal complaints than younger patients, including ulceration, bleeding, flatulence, bloating, and abdominal pain. To minimize the potential risk for gastrointestinal events, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation). Likewise, elderly patients are at greater risk of developing renal decompensation (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects).<BR>                        The pharmacokinetics of flurbiprofen do not seem to differ in elderly patients from those in younger individuals (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations). The rate of absorption of flurbiprofen was reduced in elderly patients who also received antacids, although the extent of absorption was not affected (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug<BR>                            Interactions).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
