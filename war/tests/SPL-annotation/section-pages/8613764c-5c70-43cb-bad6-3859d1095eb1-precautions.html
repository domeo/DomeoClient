In general, the concomitant administration of Chlordiazepoxide HCl/Clidinium Bromide and other psychotropic agents is not recommended. If such combination therapy seems indicated, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed â€” particularly when the known potentiating compounds such as the MAO inhibitors and phenothiazines are to be used. The usual precautions in treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed.<BR>                  Paradoxical reactions to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, eg, excitement, stimulation and acute rage, have been reported in psychiatric patients and should be watched for during Chlordiazepoxide HCl/Clidinium Bromide therapy. The usual precautions are indicated when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride is used in the treatment of anxiety states where there is any evidence of impending depression; it should be borne in mind that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary. Although clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship, physicians should be aware that variable effects on blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral anticoagulants and chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Information for Patients<BR>                     <BR>                        To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical dependence, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Geriatric subjects may be particularly prone to experiencing drowsiness, ataxia and confusion while receiving Chlordiazepoxide HCl/Clidinium Bromide. These effects can usually be avoided with proper dosage adjustment, although they have occasionally been observed even at the lower dosage ranges. Dosing in geriatric subjects should be initiated cautiously (no more than 2 capsules per day) and increased gradually if needed and tolerated (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Chlordiazepoxide HCl/Clidinium Bromide is contraindicated in the presence of glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy and benign bladder neck obstruction (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
