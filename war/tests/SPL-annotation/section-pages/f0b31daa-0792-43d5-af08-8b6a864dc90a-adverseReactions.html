Signs and symptoms were graded for severity using CTC in <BR>both studies. Within the IES study, the presence of some illnesses/conditions <BR>was monitored through a positive checklist without assessment of severity. These <BR>included myocardial infarction, other cardiovascular disorders, gynecological <BR>disorders, osteoporosis, osteoporotic fractures, other primary cancer, and <BR>hospitalizations.<BR>                  The median duration of adjuvant treatment was 27.4 months and 27.3 months for <BR>patients receiving AROMASIN or tamoxifen, respectively, within the IES study and <BR>23.9 months for patients receiving AROMASIN or placebo within the 027 study. <BR>Median duration of observation after randomization for AROMASIN was 34.5 months <BR>and for tamoxifen was 34.6 months. Median duration of observation was 30 months <BR>for both groups in the 027 study.<BR>                  AROMASIN was generally well tolerated and adverse events were usually mild to <BR>moderate. Within the IES study discontinuations due to adverse events occurred <BR>in 6.3% and 5.1% of patients receiving AROMASIN and tamoxifen, respectively, and <BR>in 12.3% and 4.1% of patients receiving exemestane or placebo within study 027. <BR>Deaths due to any cause were reported for 1.3% of the exemestane-treated <BR>patients and 1.4% of the tamoxifen-treated patients within the IES study. There <BR>were 6 deaths due to stroke on the exemestane arm compared to 2 on tamoxifen. <BR>There were 5 deaths due to cardiac failure on the exemestane arm compared to 2 <BR>on tamoxifen.<BR>                  The incidence of cardiac ischemic events (myocardial infarction, angina and <BR>myocardial ischemia) was 1.6% in exemestane treated patients and 0.6% in <BR>tamoxifen treated patients in the IES study. Cardiac failure was observed in <BR>0.4% of exemestane treated patients and 0.3% of tamoxifen treated patients.<BR>                  Treatment-emergent adverse events and illnesses including all causalities and <BR>occurring with an incidence of â‰¥5% in either treatment group of the IES study <BR>during or within one month of the end of treatment are shown in Table 8.<BR>                  <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="80%" ID="i699f9be4-a366-42cc-80cb-919d3afda1b8"><BR>                     <caption>Table 8.

<BR><BR>                  Treatment of Advanced Breast CancerA total of 1058 patients were treated with exemestane 25 mg once <BR>daily in the clinical trials program. Exemestane was generally well tolerated, <BR>and adverse events were usually mild to moderate. Only one death was considered <BR>possibly related to treatment with exemestane; an 80-year-old woman with known <BR>coronary artery disease had a myocardial infarction with multiple organ failure <BR>after 9 weeks on study treatment. In the clinical trials program, only 3% of the <BR>patients discontinued treatment with exemestane because of adverse events, <BR>mainly within the first 10 weeks of treatment; late discontinuations because of <BR>adverse events were uncommon (0.3%). <BR>                  In the comparative study, adverse reactions were assessed for 358 patients <BR>treated with AROMASIN and 400 patients treated with megestrol acetate. Fewer <BR>patients receiving AROMASIN discontinued treatment because of adverse events <BR>than those treated with megestrol acetate (2% vs. 5%). Adverse events that were <BR>considered drug related or of indeterminate cause included hot flashes (13% vs. <BR>5%), nausea (9% vs. 5%), fatigue (8% vs. 10%), increased sweating (4% vs. 8%), <BR>and increased appetite (3% vs. 6%). The proportion of patients experiencing an <BR>excessive weight gain (greater than 10% of their baseline weight) was significantly <BR>higher with megestrol acetate than with AROMASIN (17% vs. 8%).
