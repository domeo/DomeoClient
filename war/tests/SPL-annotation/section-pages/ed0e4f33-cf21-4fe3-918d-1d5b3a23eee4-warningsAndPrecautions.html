For serious skin reactions, including rash with systemic symptoms or a progressive severe rash, INCIVEK, peginterferon alfa, and ribavirin must be discontinued immediately. Consider discontinuing other medications known to be associated with serious skin reactions.

These serious skin reactions required hospitalization, and all subjects recovered. The presenting signs of DRESS may include rash, fever, facial edema, and evidence of internal organ involvement (e.g., hepatitis, nephritis). Eosinophilia may or may not be present. The presenting signs of SJS may include fever, target lesions, and mucosal erosions or ulcerations (e.g., conjunctivae, lips).<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           TEN and Erythema Multiforme (EM) have been observed in post-marketing experience [see also <BR>                                 Boxed Warning<BR>                               and <BR>                                 Adverse Reactions (6.2)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Rash events (all grades) developed in 56% of subjects who received INCIVEK combination treatment [see <BR>                                 Adverse Reactions (6.1)<BR>                              ] and in 34% of subjects who received peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Rash most frequently began during the first 4 weeks, but could occur at any time during INCIVEK combination treatment. Rash events led to discontinuation of INCIVEK alone in 6% of subjects and discontinuation of INCIVEK combination treatment in 1% of subjects. Severe rash (e.g., a generalized rash or rash with vesicles or bullae or ulcerations other than SJS) was reported in 4% of subjects who received INCIVEK combination treatment compared to less than 1% who received peginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone. The severe rash may have a prominent eczematous component.<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Patients with mild to moderate rashes should be followed for progression of rash or development of systemic symptoms. If rash progresses and becomes severe, INCIVEK should be discontinued. Peginterferon alfa and ribavirin may be continued. If improvement is not observed within 7 days of INCIVEK discontinuation, sequential or simultaneous interruption or discontinuation of ribavirin and/or peginterferon alfa should be considered. If medically indicated, earlier interruption or discontinuation of ribavirin and peginterferon alfa should be considered [see also <BR>                                 Boxed Warning<BR>                              ]. Patients should be monitored until the rash has resolved. INCIVEK must not be reduced or restarted if discontinued due to rash. Treatment of rash with oral antihistamines and/or topical corticosteroids may provide symptomatic relief but effectiveness of these measures has not been established. Treatment of rash with systemic corticosteroids is not recommended [see <BR>                                 Drug Interactions (7)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.2	Anemia<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Anemia has been reported with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy. The addition of INCIVEK to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin is associated with an additional decrease in hemoglobin concentrations. A decrease in hemoglobin levels occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment, with lowest values reached at the end of INCIVEK dosing. Hemoglobin values gradually returned to levels observed with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin after INCIVEK dosing was completed. Hemoglobin values less than or equal to 10 g per dL were observed in 36% of subjects who received INCIVEK combination treatment compared to 17% of subjects who received peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. In clinical trials, the median time to onset of hemoglobin less than or equal to 10 g per dL was faster among subjects treated with INCIVEK combination treatment compared to those who received peginterferon alfa and ribavirin: 56 days (range 8-365 days) versus 63 days (range 13-341 days), respectively. Hemoglobin values less than 8.5 g per dL were observed in 14% of subjects who received INCIVEK combination treatment compared to 5% of subjects receiving peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           In subjects receiving INCIVEK combination treatment, 32% underwent a ribavirin dose modification (reduction, interruption or discontinuation) due to anemia, 6% received a blood transfusion, 4% discontinued INCIVEK, and 1% discontinued INCIVEK combination treatment. In subjects treated with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone, 12% underwent ribavirin dose modification due to anemia, 1% received a blood transfusion, and fewer than 1% discontinued treatment. Anemia requiring ribavirin dose reduction, blood transfusion, and/or erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) has been reported to occur as soon as 10 days following initiation of INCIVEK combination treatment.<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Hemoglobin should be monitored prior to and at least at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 during INCIVEK combination treatment and as clinically appropriate. Earlier and more frequent monitoring for some patients should be considered. For the management of anemia, ribavirin dose reductions should be used (refer to the prescribing information for ribavirin for its dose reduction guidelines). If ribavirin dose reductions are inadequate, discontinuation of INCIVEK should be considered. If ribavirin is permanently discontinued for the management of anemia, INCIVEK must also be permanently discontinued. Ribavirin may be restarted per the dosing modification guidelines for ribavirin. The dose of INCIVEK must not be reduced and INCIVEK must not be restarted if discontinued.<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.3	Pregnancy: Use with Ribavirin and Peginterferon Alfa <BR>                     <BR>                        Ribavirin may cause birth defects and/or death of the exposed fetus.

Ribavirin therapy should not be started unless a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to initiation of therapy.<BR>                        Because INCIVEK must be used in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, the contraindications and warnings applicable to those drugs are applicable to combination therapy. Female patients of childbearing potential and their male partners as well as male patients and their female partners must use 2 effective contraceptive methods during treatment and for 6 months after all treatment has ended. Female patients should have monthly pregnancy tests during treatment and during the 6-month period after stopping treatment. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients as significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin [see<BR>                               Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and<BR>                               Patient Counseling Information (17.2)<BR>                           ].
