An open-label, uncontrolled study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of BUSULFEX in 24 pediatric patients receiving BUSULFEX as part of a conditioning regimen administered prior to hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation for a variety of malignant hematologic (N=15) or non-malignant diseases (N=9).  Patients ranged in age from 5 months to 16 years (median 3 years).  BUSULFEX dosing was targeted to achieve an area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of 900-1350 µM∙min with an initial dose of 0.8 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg (based on ABW) if the patient was >4 or ≤4 years, respectively.  The dose was adjusted based on plasma concentration after completion of dose 1.<BR>                              Patients received BUSULFEX doses every six hours as a two‑hour infusion over four days for a total of 16 doses, followed by cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg once daily for four days.  After one rest day, hematopoietic progenitor cells were infused.  All patients received phenytoin as seizure prophylaxis.  The target AUC (900-1350±5% µM∙min) for BUSULFEX was achieved at dose 1 in 71% (17/24) of patients. Steady state pharmacokinetic testing was performed at dose 9 and 13.  BUSULFEX levels were within the target range for 21 of 23 evaluable patients.<BR>                              All 24 patients experienced neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <0.5×109/L) and thrombocytopenia (platelet transfusions or platelet count <20,000/mm3). Seventy-nine percent (19/24) of patients experienced lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count <0.1×109).  In 23 patients, the ANC recovered to >0.5×109/L (median time to recovery = BMT day +13; range = BMT day +9 to +22).  One patient who died on day +20 had not recovered to an ANC >0.5×109/L.<BR>                              Four (17%) patients died during the study.  Two patients died within 28 days of transplant; one with pneumonia and capillary leak syndrome, and the other with pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease.  Two patients died prior to day 100; one due to progressive disease and one due to multi-organ failure.<BR>                              Adverse events were reported in all 24 patients during the study period (BMT day -10 through BMT day +28) or post-study surveillance period (day +29 through +100).  These included vomiting (100%), nausea (83%), stomatitis (79%), hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD) (21%), graft-versus host disease (GVHD) (25%), and pneumonia (21%).<BR>                              Based on the results of this 24-patient clinical trial, a suggested dosing regimen of BUSULFEX in pediatric patients is shown in the following dosing nomogram:<BR>                              <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="65%"><BR>                                 <caption>BUSULFEX Dosing Nomogram</caption><BR>                                 <col width="50%" align="center" valign="top"/><BR>                                 <col width="50%" align="center" valign="top"/><BR>                                 <thead><BR>                                    <tr><BR>                                       <th align="left">Patient's Actual <br/>Body Weight (ABW)</th><BR>                                       <th align="left">BUSULFEX Dosage</th><BR>                                    </tr><BR>                                 </thead><BR>                                 <tbody><BR>                                    <tr styleCode="Botrule"><BR>                                       <td>&#8804;12&#160;kgs</td><BR>                                       <td>1.1&#160;(mg/kg)</td><BR>                                    </tr><BR>                                    <tr><BR>                                       <td>&gt;12&#160;kgs</td><BR>                                       <td>0.8&#160;(mg/kg)</td><BR>                                    </tr><BR>                                 </tbody><BR>                              </table><BR>                              <BR><BR><BR>Simulations based on a pediatric population pharmacokinetic model indicate that approximately 60% of pediatric patients will achieve a target BUSULFEX exposure (AUC) between 900 to 1350 µM∙min with the first dose of BUSULFEX using this dosing nomogram.
