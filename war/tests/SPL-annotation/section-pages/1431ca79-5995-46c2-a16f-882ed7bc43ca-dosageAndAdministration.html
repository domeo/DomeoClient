If patients are switched from propranolol hydrochloride tablets to propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules, care should be<BR>taken to assure that the desired therapeutic effect is maintained. Propranolol hydrochloride extended-release should not be considered a simple mg-for-mg substitute for propranolol hydrochloride. Propranolol hydrochloride extended-release has different kinetics and produces lower blood levels. Retitration may be necessary, especially to maintain effectiveness at the end of the 24-hour dosing interval.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Hypertension<BR><BR>                  The usual initial dosage is 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release once daily, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. The dosage may be increased to 120 mg once daily or higher until adequate blood pressure control is achieved. The usual maintenance dosage is 120 to 160 mg once daily. In some instances a dosage of 640 mg may be required. The time needed for full hypertensive response to a given dosage is variable and may range from a few days to several weeks.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Angina Pectoris<BR><BR>                  Starting with 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release once daily, dosage should be gradually increased at three- to seven-day intervals until optimal response is obtained. Although individual patients may respond at any dosage level, the average optimal dosage appears to be 160 mg once daily. In angina pectoris, the value and safety of dosage exceeding 320 mg per day have not been established.<BR>If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce dosage gradually over a period of a few weeks (seeWARNINGS).<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Migraine<BR><BR>                  The initial oral dose is 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release once daily. The usual effective dose range is 160 to 240 mg once daily. The dosage may be increased gradually to achieve optimal migraine prophylaxis. If a satisfactory response is not obtained within four to six weeks after reaching the maximal dose, propranolol hydrochloride extended-release therapy should be discontinued. It may be advisable to withdraw the drug gradually over a period of several weeks depending on the patient's age, comorbidity, and dose of propranolol hydrochloride extended-release.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Hypertrophic Subaortic Stenosis<BR><BR>                  The usual dosage is 80 to 160 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release once daily.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
