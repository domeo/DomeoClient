Anyone considering the use of STRATTERA in a child or adolescent must balance this risk with the clinical need. Co-morbidities occurring with ADHD may be associated with an increase in the risk of suicidal ideation and/or behavior. Patients who are started on therapy should be monitored closely for suicidality (suicidal thinking and behavior), clinical worsening, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. STRATTERA is approved for ADHD in pediatric and adult patients. STRATTERA is not approved for major depressive disorder.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Pooled analyses of short-term (6 to 18 weeks) placebo-controlled trials of STRATTERA in children and adolescents (a total of 12 trials involving over 2200 patients, including 11 trials in ADHD and 1 trial in enuresis) have revealed a greater risk of suicidal ideation early during treatment in those receiving STRATTERA compared to placebo. The average risk of suicidal ideation in patients receiving STRATTERA was 0.4% (5/1357 patients), compared to none in placebo-treated patients (851 patients). No suicides occurred in these trials<BR><BR>                     [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].<BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           WARNING: SUICIDAL IDEATION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Increased risk of suicidal ideation in children or adolescents<BR><BR>                              (5.1)<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              No suicides occurred in clinical trials<BR><BR>                              (5.1)<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              Patients started on therapy should be monitored closely<BR><BR>                              (5.1)<BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
