Based on experience with exemestane at repeated doses up to 200 mg daily that demonstrated a moderate increase in non life-threatening adverse events, dosage adjustment does not appear to be necessary [see Use In Specific Populations (8.6 and 8.7)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
