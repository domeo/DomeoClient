The symptoms must not be better accounted for by another<BR>mental disorder.<BR>                        The specific etiology of ADHD is unknown, and<BR>there is no single diagnostic test. Adequate diagnosis requires the use not<BR>only of medical but also of special psychological, educational, and social<BR>resources. Learning may or may not be impaired. The diagnosis must be based<BR>upon a complete history and evaluation of the patient and not solely on the<BR>presence of the required number of DSM–IV characteristics.<BR>                        For the Inattentive Type, at least 6 of the following symptoms must<BR>have persisted for at least 6 months: lack of attention to<BR>details/careless mistakes, lack of sustained attention, poor listener, failure<BR>to follow through on tasks, poor organization, avoids tasks requiring sustained<BR>mental effort, loses things, easily distracted, forgetful. For the Hyperactive–Impulsive<BR>Type, at least 6 of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least<BR>6 months: fidgeting/squirming, leaving seat, inappropriate running/climbing,<BR>difficulty with quiet activities, “on the go,” excessive talking,<BR>blurting answers, can’t wait turn, intrusive. For a Combined Type diagnosis,<BR>both inattentive and hyperactive–impulsive criteria must be met.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     1.3  Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program<BR>                     <BR>                        STRATTERA is<BR>indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for ADHD that may<BR>include other measures (psychological, educational, social) for patients with<BR>this syndrome. Drug treatment may not be indicated for all patients with this<BR>syndrome. Drug treatment is not intended for use in the patient who exhibits<BR>symptoms secondary to environmental factors and/or other primary psychiatric<BR>disorders, including psychosis. Appropriate educational placement is essential<BR>in children and adolescents with this diagnosis and psychosocial intervention<BR>is often helpful. When remedial measures alone are insufficient, the decision<BR>to prescribe drug treatment medication will depend upon the physician’s<BR>assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patient’s symptoms.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
