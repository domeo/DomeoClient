For patients with triglycerides (TG) <400 mg/dL (<4.5 mmol/L), LDL-C can be estimated using the following equation: <BR>                  LDL-C = Total-C - HDL-C - 1/5 TG <BR>                  For TG levels >400 mg/dL (>4.5 mmol/L), this equation is less accurate and LDL-C concentrations should be determined by ultracentrifugation. In many hypertriglyceridemic patients, LDL-C may be low or normal despite elevated Total-C. In such cases, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are not indicated. <BR>                  Lipid determinations should be performed at intervals of no less than four weeks and dosage adjusted according to the patient’s response to therapy. <BR>                  The National Cholesterol Education Program’s Treatment Guidelines are summarized below: <BR>                  <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><BR>                     <col width="27%"/><BR>                     <col width="14%"/><BR>                     <col width="26%"/><BR>                     <col width="34%"/><BR>                     <tbody><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td valign="top" colspan="4"><BR>                              <paragraph><BR>                                 <content styleCode="bold">d D rugT erap n Di eren R ik C teori s </content><BR>                              </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td valign="bottom"><BR>                              <paragraph>Ris k at gory </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="bottom" align="center"><BR>                              <paragraph>L D Go l ( g/ L </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center"><BR>                              <paragraph>LD L Le elat Whch to n itiat h e a puti Lifes y l ange (mg L) </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="bottom"><BR>                              <paragraph>L LL el a Whc to Co siderDr g Th rpy(m g /dL </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td valign="top"><BR>                              <paragraph>C Da r CHD isk eq iv lets ( 0-ye r rik &gt;20% </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td align="center"><BR>                              <paragraph>&lt;100 </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td align="center"><BR>                              <paragraph>&#8805;100 </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="top"><BR>                              <paragraph>&#8805; 130 ( 00-1 9: dr g opt ona )b</paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td rowspan="2"><BR>                              <paragraph>2 R sk facto s (10-ye r risk &#8804; 20%) </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td align="center" rowspan="2"><BR>                              <paragraph>&lt;13 </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td align="center" rowspan="2"><BR>                              <paragraph>&#8805;1 0 </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <paragraph>1 -year ris 10% 20%: &#8805; 30 </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td valign="top"><BR>                              <paragraph>10-y ar risk &lt;10% &#8805;160 </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <paragraph>0 1 R sk fac orc</paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td align="center"><BR>                              <paragraph>&lt; 60 </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td align="center"><BR>                              <paragraph>&#8805;160 </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="top"><BR>                              <paragraph>&#8805;190 160- 89: LDL lowe ing d ug op ional) </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                     </tbody><BR>                  </table><BR>                  <BR><BR><BR><BR>                     a CHD, coronary heart disease.<BR>                  <BR>                     b Some authorities recommend the use of LDL-lowering drugs in this category if an LDL-C level of    <100 mg/dL cannot be achieved by therapeutic lifestyle changes. Others prefer use of drugs that primarily modify triglycerides and HDL-C, e.g., nicotinic acid or fibrate. Clinical judgement also may call for deferring drug therapy in this subcategory.<BR>                  <BR>                     c Almost all people with 0-1 risk factor have 10-year risk <10%; thus, 10-year risk assessment in people with 0-1 risk factor is not necessary.<BR>                  After the LDL-C goal has been achieved, if the TG is still ³200 mg/dL, non-HDL-C (Total-C minus HDL-C) becomes a secondary target of therapy. Non-HDL-C goals are set 30 mg/dL higher than LDL-C goals for each risk category.<BR>                  At the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary event, consideration can be given to initiating drug therapy at discharge if the LDL-C is ³130 mg/dL (see NCEP Treatment Guidelines, above).<BR>                  Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the NCEP recommends that LDL-C levels be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDL-C levels are not available, should the Total-C be used to monitor therapy.<BR>                  As with other lipid-lowering therapy, Pravastatin sodium tablets are not indicated when hypercholesterolemia is due to hyperalphalipoproteinemia (elevated HDL-C).<BR>                  The NCEP classification of cholesterol levels in pediatric patients with a familial history of hypercholesterolemia or premature cardiovascular disease is summarized below:<BR>                  <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><BR>                     <col width="145.2pt"/><BR>                     <col width="150.6pt"/><BR>                     <col width="145.2pt"/><BR>                     <tbody><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center" styleCode="     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "><BR>                              <paragraph><BR>                                 <content styleCode="bold">Category</content><BR>                              </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center" styleCode="     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "><BR>                              <paragraph><BR>                                 <content styleCode="bold">Total-C (mg/dL)</content><BR>                              </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center" styleCode="     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "><BR>                              <paragraph><BR>                                 <content styleCode="bold">LDL-C (mg/dL)</content><BR>                              </paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center" styleCode="     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "><BR>                              <paragraph>Acceptable</paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center" styleCode="     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "><BR>                              <paragraph>&lt;170</paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center" styleCode="     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "><BR>                              <paragraph>&lt;110</paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center" styleCode="     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "><BR>                              <paragraph>Borderline</paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center" styleCode="     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "><BR>                              <paragraph>170-199</paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center" styleCode="     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "><BR>                              <paragraph>110-129</paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center" styleCode="     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "><BR>                              <paragraph>High</paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center" styleCode="     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "><BR>                              <paragraph>&#179;200</paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td valign="top" align="center" styleCode="     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "><BR>                              <paragraph>&#179;130</paragraph><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                     </tbody><BR>                  </table><BR>               <BR><BR><BR><BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
