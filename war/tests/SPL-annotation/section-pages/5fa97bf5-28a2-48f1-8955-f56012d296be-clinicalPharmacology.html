Lenalidomide possesses immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and antineoplastic properties.  Experiments have demonstrated that lenalidomide inhibits the growth of cells derived from patients with multiple myeloma and del (5q) myelodysplastic syndromes in vitro. Lenalidomide causes a delay in tumor growth in some in vivo nonclinical hematopoietic tumor models, including multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  Lenalidomide also inhibited the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) but not COX-1 in vitro.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.2	Pharmacodynamics<BR>                     <BR>                        The effect of lenalidomide on the QTc interval was evaluated in 60 healthy male subjects in a randomized, thorough QT study with placebo and positive controls.  At a dose two times the maximum recommended dose, lenalidomide does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. The largest upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for the mean differences between lenalidomide and placebo was below 10 ms.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.3	Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Absorption<BR>                        <BR>                        Lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Following single and multiple doses of REVLIMID in patients with MM or MDS the maximum plasma concentrations occurred between 0.5 and 6.0 hours post-dose. The single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of lenalidomide is linear with AUC and Cmax values increasing proportionally with dose. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in drug accumulation.<BR>                        Systemic exposure (AUC) of lenalidomide in MM and MDS patients with normal or mild renal function (CLcr ≥ 60 mL/min) is approximately 60% higher as compared to young healthy male subjects. <BR>                        Administration of a single 25 mg dose of REVLIMID with a high-fat meal in healthy subjects reduces the extent of absorption, with an approximate 20% decrease in AUC and 50% decrease in Cmax.  In the trials where the efficacy and safety were established for REVLIMID, the drug was administered without regard to food intake.  REVLIMID can be administered with or without food. <BR>                        <BR>                           Distribution<BR>                        <BR>                        In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%.<BR>                        <BR>                           Metabolism<BR>                        <BR>                        Lenalidomide -undergoes limited metabolism.  Unchanged lenalidomide is the predominant circulating component in humans.  Two identified metabolites are hydroxy-lenalidomide and N-acetyl-lenalidomide; each constitutes less than 5% of parent levels in circulation.<BR>                        <BR>                           Elimination<BR>                        <BR>                        Elimination is primarily renal. Following a single oral administration of [14C]-lenalidomide (25 mg) to healthy subjects, approximately 90% and 4% of the radioactive dose is eliminated within ten days in urine and feces, respectively. Approximately 82% of the radioactive dose is excreted as lenalidomide in the urine within 24 hours.  Hydroxy-lenalidomide and N-acetyl-lenalidomide represent 4.59% and 1.83% of the excreted dose, respectively.  The renal clearance of lenalidomide exceeds the glomerular filtration rate. <BR>                        The mean half-life of lenalidomide is 3 hours in healthy subjects and 3 to 5 hours in patients with multiple myeloma or MDS.<BR>                        <BR>                           Special Populations<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Patients with Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide were studied in patients with renal impairment due to nonmalignant conditions. In this study, 5 patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 57-74 mL/min), 6 patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 33-46 mL/min), 6 patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 17-29 mL/min), and 6 patients with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis were administered a single oral 25-mg dose of REVLIMID. As a control group comparator, 7 healthy subjects of similar age with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 83-145 mL/min) were also administered a single oral 25-mg dose of REVLIMID. As creatinine clearance decreased from mild to severe impairment, half-life increased and drug clearance decreased linearly. Patients with moderate and severe renal impairment had a 3-fold increase in half-life and a 66% to 75% decrease in drug clearance compared to healthy subjects. Patients on hemodialysis (n=6) given a single, 25-mg dose of lenalidomide has an approximate 4.5-fold increase in half-life and an 80% decrease in drug clearance compared to healthy subjects. Approximately 40% of the administered dose was removed from the body during a single dialysis session.<BR>                        In multiple myeloma patients, those patients with mild renal impairment had an AUC 56% greater than those with normal renal function.<BR>                        Adjustment of the starting dose of REVLIMID is recommended in patients with moderate or severe (CLcr < 60 mL/min) renal impairment and in patients on dialysis.
