CLINICAL TRIALS). The usefulness of the drug in adult and pediatric patients receiving fluoxetine for extended periods should be reevaluated periodically. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Adult<BR>Fluoxetine is indicated for the treatment of obsessions and compulsions in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as defined in the DSM-III-R; i.e., the obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming, or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning.The efficacy of fluoxetine was established in 13-week trials with obsessive-compulsive outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III-R category of OC (see CLINICAL TRIALS).CLINICAL TRIALS).OCD is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images (obsessions) that are ego-dystonic and/or repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors (compulsions) that are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable.The effectiveness of fluoxetine in long-term use, i.e., for more than 13 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in placebo-controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use fluoxetine for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Pediatric (children and adolescents)<BR>The efficacy of fluoxetine in children and adolescents was established in a 13-week, dose titration, clinical trial in patients with OCD, as defined in DSM-IV (see CLINICAL TRIALS).

Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use fluoxetine for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).CLINICAL TRIALS).

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks, and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks.The efficacy of fluoxetine hydrochloride was established in two 12-week clinical trials in patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IV category of panic disorder  (see CLINICAL TRIALS). CLINICAL TRIALS). Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which 4 or more of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: 1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; 2) sweating; 3) trembling or shaking; 4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; 5) feeling of choking; 6) chest pain or discomfort; 7) nausea or abdominal distress; 8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; 9) fear of losing control; 10) fear of dying; 11) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); 12) chills or hot flashes.The effectiveness of fluoxetine hydrochloride in long-term use, i.e., for more than 12 weeks, has not been established in placebo-controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use fluoxetine hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></P></DIV></HTML>
