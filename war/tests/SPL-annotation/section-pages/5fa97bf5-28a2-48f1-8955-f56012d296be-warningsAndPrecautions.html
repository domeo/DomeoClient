Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes life-threatening human birth defects or embryo-fetal death [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. An embryo-fetal development study in non-human primates indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy, similar to birth defects observed in humans following exposure to thalidomide during pregnancy. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           REVLIMID is only available through the REVLIMID REMS<BR>                                 ™<BR>                               program (formerly known as the “RevAssist® program”) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].<BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Females of Reproductive Potential<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning REVLIMID therapy, during therapy, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy.<BR>                        <BR>                           Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with REVLIMID, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of REVLIMID therapy. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy.

It is not known whether prophylactic anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy prescribed in conjunction with REVLIMID may lessen the potential for venous thromboembolism.
