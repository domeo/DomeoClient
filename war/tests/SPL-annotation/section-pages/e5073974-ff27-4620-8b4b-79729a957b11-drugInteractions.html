The available knowledge concerning the relationship of fluvoxamine and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system has been obtained mostly from pharmacokinetic interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers, but some preliminary in vitro data are also available. Based on a finding of substantial interactions of fluvoxamine with certain of these drugs [see later parts of this section and also Warnings and Precautions (5)] and limited in vitro data for CYP3A4, it appears that fluvoxamine inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes that are known to be involved in the metabolism of other drugs such as: CYP1A2 (e.g., warfarin, theophylline, propranolol, tizanidine), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), CYP3A4 (e.g., alprazolam), and CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole).<BR>                        <BR>                           In vitro data suggest that fluvoxamine is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6.<BR>                        Approximately 7% of the normal population has a genetic code that leads to reduced levels of activity of CYP2D6. Such individuals have been referred to as “poor metabolizers” (PM) of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and tricyclic antidepressants. While none of the drugs studied for drug interactions significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of fluvoxamine, an in vivo study of fluvoxamine single-dose pharmacokinetics in 13 PM subjects demonstrated altered pharmacokinetic properties compared to 16 “extensive metabolizers” (EM): mean Cmax, AUC, and half-life were increased by 52%, 200%, and 62%, respectively, in the PM compared to the EM group. This suggests that fluvoxamine is metabolized, at least in part, by CYP2D6. Caution is indicated in patients known to have reduced levels of CYP2D6 activity and those receiving concomitant drugs known to inhibit this cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (e.g., quinidine).<BR>                        The metabolism of fluvoxamine has not been fully characterized and the effects of potent cytochrome P450 isoenzyme inhibition, such as the ketoconazole inhibition of CYP3A4, on fluvoxamine metabolism have not been studied.<BR>                        A clinically significant fluvoxamine interaction is possible with drugs having a narrow therapeutic ratio such as pimozide, warfarin, theophylline, certain benzodiazepines, omeprazole and phenytoin. If fluvoxamine maleate tablets are to be administered together with a drug that is eliminated via oxidative metabolism and has a narrow therapeutic window, plasma levels and/or pharmacodynamic effects of the latter drug should be monitored closely, at least until steady state conditions are reached [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.2 CNS Active Drugs<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Antipsychotics<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           See Warnings and Precautions (5.3).<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Benzodiazepines<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           See Warnings and Precautions (5.8).<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Alprazolam<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           See Warnings and Precautions (5.8).<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Diazepam<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           See Warnings and Precautions (5.8).<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Lorazepam<BR>                        <BR>                        A study of multiple doses of fluvoxamine maleate (50 mg b.i.d.) in healthy male volunteers (N = 12) and a single dose of lorazepam (4 mg single dose) indicated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction.
