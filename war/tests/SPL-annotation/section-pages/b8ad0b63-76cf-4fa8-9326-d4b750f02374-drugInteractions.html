DRUG INTERACTIONS<BR>               <BR>                  Celecoxib metabolism is predominantly mediated via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 in the liver.  Co-administration of celecoxib with drugs that are known to inhibit CYP2C9 should be done with caution. Significant interactions may occur when celecoxib is administered together with drugs that inhibit CYP2C9.<BR>                            General:<BR>                  <BR>                  studies indicate that celecoxib, although not a substrate, is an inhibitor of CYP2D6.  Therefore, there is a potential for an drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6.<BR>                            In vitro<BR>                     in vivo<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Concomitant use of CELEBREX and warfarin may result in increased risk of bleeding complications.

The effect of celecoxib on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily 2â€“5 mg doses of warfarin. In these subjects, celecoxib did not alter the anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time. However, in post-marketing experience, serious bleeding events, some of which were fatal, have been reported, predominantly in the elderly, in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving CELEBREX concurrently with warfarin.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.2	Lithium<BR>                     <BR>                        In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving lithium 450 mg twice daily with CELEBREX 200 mg twice daily as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone. Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when CELEBREX is introduced or withdrawn.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.3	Aspirin<BR>                     <BR>                        CELEBREX can be used with low-dose aspirin. However, concomitant administration of aspirin with CELEBREX increases the rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of CELEBREX alone [ ].<BR>                                    see , and<BR>                                        Warnings and Precautions (5.1<BR>                              5.4)<BR>                              Clinical Studies (14.6)<BR>                           <BR>                           Because of its lack of platelet effects, CELEBREX is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis<BR>                           [ ].<BR>                                        see<BR>                                            Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)<BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.4	ACE-inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists<BR>                     <BR>                        Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking CELEBREX concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists [ ].<BR>                                    see<BR>                                        Clinical Pharmacology (12.2<BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.5	Fluconazole<BR>                     <BR>                        Concomitant administration of fluconazole at 200 mg once daily resulted in a two-fold increase in celecoxib plasma concentration. This increase is due to the inhibition of celecoxib metabolism via P450 2C9 by fluconazole [ ].
