At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, fully digitalize patients and/or give a diuretic. The response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues, despite adequate digitalization and diuretic therapy, withdraw Lopressor.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Ischemic Heart Disease: Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered Lopressor, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of 1-2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, Lopressor administration should be reinstated promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician’s advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue Lopressor therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Bronchospastic Diseases<BR>                           : <BR>                           PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD, IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA BLOCKERS<BR>                           , including Lopressor<BR>                           .

In these circumstances it would be prudent initially to administer Lopressor in smaller doses three times daily, instead of larger doses two times daily, to avoid the higher plasma levels associated with the longer dosing interval (<BR>                           see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Major Surgery<BR>                           : Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.<BR>                        <BR>                           Diabetes and Hypoglycemia<BR>                           : Beta blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected.<BR>                        <BR>                           Pheochromocytoma: <BR>                            If Lopressor is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated.  Administration of beta blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle. <BR>                        <BR>                           Thyrotoxicosis<BR>                           : Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade, which might precipitate a thyroid storm.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Myocardial Infarction<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Cardiac Failure<BR>                           : Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function, and beta blockade carries the potential hazard of depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating or exacerbating minimal cardiac failure.<BR>                        During treatment with Lopressor, monitor the hemodynamic status of the patient. If heart failure occurs or persists despite appropriate treatment, discontinue Lopressor.<BR>                        <BR>                           Bradycardia<BR>                           : Lopressor produces a decrease in sinus heart rate in most patients; this decrease is greatest among patients with high initial heart rates and least among patients with low initial heart rates. Acute myocardial infarction (particularly inferior infarction) may in itself produce significant lowering of the sinus rate. If the sinus rate decreases to <40 beats/min, particularly if associated with evidence of lowered cardiac output, atropine (0.25-0.5 mg) should be administered intravenously. If treatment with atropine is not successful, discontinue Lopressor and consider cautious administration of isoproterenol or installation of a cardiac pacemaker.<BR>                        <BR>                           AV Block<BR>                           : Lopressor slows AV conduction and may produce significant first- (P-R interval ≥0.26 sec), second-, or third-degree heart block. Acute myocardial infarction also produces heart block.<BR>                        If heart block occurs, discontinue Lopressor and administer atropine (0.25-0.5 mg) intravenously. If treatment with atropine is not successful, consider administration of isoproterenol or installation of a cardiac pacemaker.<BR>                        <BR>                           Hypotension<BR>                           : If hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤90 mmHg) occurs, discontinue Lopressor, and assess the hemodynamic status of the patient and the extent of myocardial damage. Invasive monitoring of central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge, and arterial pressures may be required. Institute appropriate therapy with fluids, positive inotropic agents, balloon counterpulsation, or other treatment modalities. If hypotension is associated with sinus bradycardia or AV block, direct treatment at reversing these (see above).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
