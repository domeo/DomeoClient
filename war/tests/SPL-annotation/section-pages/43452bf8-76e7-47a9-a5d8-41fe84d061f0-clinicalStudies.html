For the 12-16 mg/day group, the titration schedule of FANAPT was 1 mg twice daily on days 1 and 2, 2 mg twice daily on days 3 and 4, 4 mg twice daily on days 5 and 6, and 6 mg twice daily on day 7. For the 20-24 mg/day group, the titration schedule of FANAPT was 1 mg twice daily on day 1, 2 mg twice daily on day 2, 4 mg twice daily on day 3, 6 mg twice daily on days 4 and 5, 8 mg twice daily on day 6, and 10 mg twice daily on day 7. The primary endpoint was change from baseline on the BPRS total score at the end of treatment (Day 42). Both the 12-16 mg/day and the 20-24 mg/day dose ranges of FANAPT were superior to placebo on the BPRS total score. The active control antipsychotic drug appeared to be superior to FANAPT in this trial within the first 2 weeks, a finding that may in part be explained by the more rapid titration that was possible for that drug. In patients in this study who remained on treatment for at least two weeks, iloperidone appeared to have had comparable efficacy to the active control.<BR>                  A 4-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=604) involved one fixed dose of FANAPT (24 mg/day) compared to placebo and an active control (ziprasidone). The titration schedule for this study was similar to that for the 6-week study. This study involved titration of FANAPT starting at 1 mg twice daily on day 1 and increasing to 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 mg twice daily on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The primary endpoint was change from baseline on the PANSS total score at the end of treatment (Day 28). The 24 mg/day FANAPT dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS total score. FANAPT appeared to have similar efficacy to the active control drug which also needed a slow titration to the target dose. <BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
