If a daily dose of 40 mg does not achieve desired cholesterol levels, 80 mg once daily is recommended. In patients with significant renal impairment, a starting dose of 10 mg daily is recommended. Pravastatin sodium tablets USP can be administered orally as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. Since the maximal effect of a given dose is seen within 4 weeks, periodic lipid determinations should be performed at this time and dosage adjusted according to the patientâ€™s response to therapy and established treatment guidelines. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.3 Pediatric Patients <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Children (Ages 8 to 13 Years, Inclusive)<BR>                        <BR>                        The recommended dose is 20 mg once daily in children 8 to 13 years of age.

When administering a bile-acid-binding resin (e.g., cholestyramine, colestipol) and pravastatin, pravastatin sodium tablets USP should be given either 1 hour or more before or at least 4 hours following the resin.

Most patients treated with this combination received a maximum pravastatin sodium dose of 20 mg/day. In patients taking cyclosporine, therapy should be limited to 20 mg of pravastatin sodium once daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Clarithromycin <BR>                     <BR>                        In patients taking clarithromycin, therapy should be limited to 40 mg of pravastatin sodium once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
