Dose-ranging in COPD patients (Trials 2 and 3) provided supportive information. <BR>                  <BR>                     Dose<BR>                     -<BR>                     ranging in asthma<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     ARCAPTA NEOHALER<BR>                      is not indicated for asthma.<BR>                  <BR>                  Trial 1 was a 2-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design that enrolled 511 patients with persistent asthma 18 years of age and older. All enrolled patients were required to be taking inhaled corticosteroids, had a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of ≥ 50% and ≤ 90% predicted, and FEV1 reversibility after albuterol of at least 12% and at least 200 mL. Trial 1 included ARCAPTA NEOHALER doses of 18.75, 37.5, 75, and 150 mcg once daily, a salmeterol active control group, and placebo. The trial showed that the effect on FEV1 in patients treated with ARCAPTA NEOHALER 18.75 and 37.5 mcg doses was lower compared to patients treated with other ARCAPTA NEOHALER doses, particularly after the first dose. The effect did not clearly differ between the 75 and 150 mcg doses.<BR>                  Results of the ARCAPTA NEOHALER and placebo treatment arms are as follows. After the first dose (Day 1), the peak (4 hour) FEV1 was 2.58L in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of 0.04L (95% CI -0.01, 0.09) in the 18.75 mcg ARCAPTA NEOHALER group, 0.04L (-0.01, 0.09) in the 37.5 mcg group, 0.12L (0.07, 0.17) in the 75 mcg group, and 0.15L (0.10, 0.20) in the 150 mcg group. The Day 2 trough FEV1 was 2.45L in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of 0.02L (95% CI -0.05, 0.08), 0.08L (0.01, 0.15), 0.09L (0.03, 0.16) and  0.16L (0.09, 0.22) in the ARCAPTA NEOHALER groups, respectively. At Day 14, the peak (4 hour) FEV1 was 2.55L in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of 0.12L (95% CI 0.05, 0.20) in the 18.75 mcg ARCAPTA NEOHALER group, 0.14L (0.06, 0.21) in the 37.5 mcg group, 0.23L (0.15, 0.30) in the 75 mcg group, and 0.20L (0.13, 0.27) in the 150 mcg group. The Day 15 FEV1 (primary endpoint) was 2.42L in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of 0.09L (95% CI 0.00, 0.17), 0.11L (0.02, 0.19), 0.17L (0.08, 0.26), and 0.12L (0.04, 0.21) in the ARCAPTA NEOHALER groups, respectively.<BR>                  <BR>                     Dose<BR>                     -<BR>                     ranging in COPD<BR>                  <BR>                  Trial 2 was a 2-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design that enrolled 552 patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, who were 40 years or older, had a smoking history of at least 10 pack years, had a post-bronchodilator FEV1<BR>                      less than 80% and at least 30% of the predicated normal value and a post-bronchodilator ratio of FEV1 over forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) of less than 70%.  Trial 2 included ARCAPTA NEOHALER doses of 18.75, 37.5, 75 and 150 mcg once daily, a salmeterol active control group, and placebo.

Although a dose-response relationship was observed at week 2, the effect did not clearly differ among the ARCAPTA NEOHALER doses.    <BR>                  <BR>                     Confirmatory Trials:<BR>                  <BR>                  The ARCAPTA NEOHALER COPD development program included six confirmatory trials that were randomized, double-blinded placebo and active-controlled in design (Trial 3, a 26-week seamless adaptive design trial that included an initial 2 week dose-ranging phase; Trials 4, 5, and 6, 12-week trials; Trial 7, a 26-week trial; and Trial 8, a 52 week trial). After the initial 2-week dose-ranging portion of the design, Trial 3 was conducted with ARCAPTA NEOHALER doses of 150 mcg and 300 mcg once daily, placebo, and an active comparator. Trials 4 and 5 were conducted with ARCAPTA NEOHALER dose of 75 mcg once daily, and placebo. Trial 6 was conducted with ARCAPTA NEOHALER dose of 150 mcg once daily and placebo. Trial 7 was conducted with ARCAPTA NEOHALER dose of 150 mcg once daily, an active comparator, and placebo. Trial 8 was conducted with ARCAPTA NEOHALER doses of 300 mcg and 600 mcg once daily, an active comparator, and placebo. <BR>                  As Trials 3, 6, 7, and 8 were conducted with doses of ARCAPTA NEOHALER higher than 75 mcg, the results of Trials 4 and 5, which included ARCAPTA NEOHALER 75 mcg are the focus of this section.<BR>                  These six trials enrolled 5474 patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, who were 40 years or older, had a smoking history of at least 10 pack years, had a post-bronchodilator FEV1 less than 80% and at least 30% of the predicted normal value and a post-bronchodilator ratio of FEV1 over FVC of less than 70%. <BR>                  Assessment of efficacy in these six COPD trials was based on FEV1. The primary efficacy endpoint was 24-hour post-dose trough FEV1 (defined as the average of two FEV1 measurements taken after 23 hours 10 minutes and 23 hours and 45 minutes after the previous dose) after 12 weeks of treatment in all 6 trials. Other efficacy variables included other FEV1 and FVC time points, rescue medication use, symptoms, and health-related quality of life measured using the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).<BR>                  In all six confirmatory COPD trials, all doses of ARCAPTA NEOHALER tested (75 mcg, 150 mcg, 300 mcg, and 600 mcg) showed significantly greater 24-hour post-dose trough FEV1 compared to placebo at 12 weeks. Results of Trials 4 and 5, which compared ARCAPTA NEOHALER at the dose of 75 mcg once daily to placebo are shown in Table 2.<BR>                  <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><BR>                     <caption>Table 2: LS Mean for trough FEV<sub>1</sub> at 12 weeks</caption><BR>                     <col width="151"/><BR>                     <col width="180"/><BR>                     <col width="180"/><BR>                     <tbody><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Treatment</content><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td align="center"><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Trough FEV</content><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold"><BR>                                 <sub>1</sub><BR>                              </content><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold"> at Week 12 (liters)</content><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td align="center"><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Treatment Difference</content><BR>                              <br/><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">LS Mean (95% CI)</content><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td styleCode="Toprule " colspan="3">Trial 4 (N=323)</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td styleCode="Toprule ">Indacaterol 75 mcg</td><BR>                           <td styleCode="Toprule " align="center">1.38</td><BR>                           <td styleCode="Toprule " align="center">0.12 (0.08, 0.15)</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td>Placebo</td><BR>                           <td align="center">1.26</td><BR>                           <td align="center"/><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td styleCode="Toprule " colspan="3">Trial 5 (N=318)</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td styleCode="Toprule ">Indacaterol 75 mcg</td><BR>                           <td styleCode="Toprule " align="center">1.49</td><BR>                           <td styleCode="Toprule " align="center">0.14 (0.10, 0.18)</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td>Placebo</td><BR>                           <td align="center">1.35</td><BR>                           <td align="center"/><BR>                        </tr><BR>                     </tbody><BR>                  </table><BR>                  <BR><BR><BR>In addition, serial FEV1 measurements in patients treated with ARCAPTA NEOHALER demonstrated a bronchodilatory treatment effect after the first dose compared to placebo at 5 minutes post dose of 0.09 L (Trial 4) and 0.10 L (Trial 5).  The mean peak improvement relative to baseline within the first 4 hours after the first dose (Day 1) was 0.19 L (Trial 4) and 0.22 L (Trial 5) and was 0.24 L (Trial 4) and 0.27 L (Trial 5) after 12 weeks.  Improvement in lung function observed at week 4 was consistently maintained over the 12-week treatment period in both trials.

SGRQ is a disease-specific patient reported instrument which measures symptoms, activities, and its impact on daily life.  At week 12, pooled data from these trials demonstrated an improvement over placebo in SGRQ total score of -3.8 with a 95% CI of (-5.3, -2.3) for the ARCAPTA NEOHALER 75 mcg dose, -4.6 with a 95% CI of (-5.5, -3.6) for 150 mcg, and -3.8 with a 95% CI of (-4.9, -2.8) for 300 mcg. The confidence intervals for this change are widely overlapping with no dose ordering. Results from individual studies were variable, but are generally consistent with the pooled data results. <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     Figure 1: LS Mean FEV1 time profile curve over 24 hours after ARCAPTA NEOHALER Day 1 and Week 2 in Trial 2 (COPD dose ranging)<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     Figure 2: LS Mean FEV1 time profile curve over 24 hours at Week 12 in Trial 5<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
