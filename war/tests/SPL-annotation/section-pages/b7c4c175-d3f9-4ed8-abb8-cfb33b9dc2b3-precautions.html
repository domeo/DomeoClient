These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels.  Even at labeled dosage regiments, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may experience overdose symptoms such as extreme sleepiness, confusion or shallow breathing.The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1-10% in Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16-28% in North Africans, Ethiopians and Arabs. Data is not available for other ethnic groups.When physicians prescribe codeine-containing drugs, they should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and should inform their patients about these risks and the signs of morphine overdose.

Such tasks should be avoided while taking this product.Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive CNS depression, when taken with this combination product, and should be avoided.Codeine may be habit-forming. Patients should take the drug only for as long as it is prescribed, in the amounts prescribed, and no more frequently than prescribed.Caution patients that some people have a variation in a liver enzyme and change codeine into morphine more rapidly and completely than other people.  These people are ultra-rapid metabolizers and are more likely to have higher-than-normal levels of morphine in their blood after taking codeine which can result in overdose symptoms such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing. In most cases, it is unknown if someone is an ultra-rapid codeine metabolizer.Nursing mothers taking codeine can also have higher morphine levels in their breast milk if they are ultra-rapid metabolizers. These higher levels of morphine in breast milk may lead to life threatening of fatal side effects in nursing babies. Instruct nursing mothers to watch for signs of morphine toxicity in their infants including increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness.  Instruct nursing mothers to talk to the baby's doctor immediately if they notice these signs and, if they cannot reach the doctor right away, to take the baby to an emergency room or call 911 (or local emergency services).<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Laboratory Tests<BR>In patients with severe hepatic or renal disease, effects of therapy should be monitored with serial liver and/or renal function tests.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Drug Interactions<BR>This drug may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetic, tranquilizers such as chloridazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions<BR>Codeine may increase serum amylase levels.Acetaminophen may produce false-positive test results for urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility<BR>No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether acetaminophen and codeine have a potential for carcinogenesis or mutagenesis. No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether acetaminophen has a potential for impairment of fertility.Acetaminophen and codeine have been found to have no mutagenic potential using the Ames Salmonella-Microsomal Activation test, the Basc test on Drosophila germ cells, and the Micronucleus test on mouse bone marrow.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Pregnancy<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Codeine: A study in rats and rabbits reported no teratogenic effect of codeine administered during the period of organogenesis in doses ranging from 5 to 120 mg/kg.

The closer to delivery and the larger the dose used, the greater the possibility of respiratory depression in the newborn. Narcotic analgesics should be avoided during labor if delivery of a premature infant is anticipated. If the mother has received narcotic analgesics during labor, newborn infants should be observed closely for signs of respiratory depression. Resuscitation may be required (see OVERDOSAGE). The effect of codeine, if any, on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown.OVERDOSAGE).

In women with normal codeine metabolism (normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent.  Despite the common use of codeine products to manage postpartum pain, reports of adverse events in infants are rare.  However, some women are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. These women achieve higher-than-expected serum levels of codeine's active metabolite, morphine, leading to higher-than-expected levels of morphine in breast milk and potentially dangerously high serum morphine levels in their breastfed infants.  Therefore, maternal use of codeine can potentially lead to serious adverse reactions, including death, in nursing infants.The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1-10% in Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16-28% in North Africans, Ethiopians and Arabs. Data is not available for other ethnic groups.The risk of infant exposure to codeine and morphine through breast milk should be weighed against the benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and baby.  Caution should be exercised when codeine is administered to a nursing woman.  If a codeine containing product is selected, the lowest dose should be prescribed for the shortest period of time to achieve the desired clinical effect.  Mothers using codeine should be informed about when to seek immediate medical care and how to identify the signs and symptoms of neonatal toxicity, such as drowsiness or sedation, difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, and decreased tone, in their baby.  Nursing mothers who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may also experience overdose symptoms such as extreme sleepiness, confusion or shallow breathing.  Prescribers should closely monitor mother-infant pairs and notify treating pediatricians about the use of codeine during breastfeeding.
