Anyone considering the use of fluoxetine or any <BR>other antidepressant in a child, adolescent or young adult must balance this <BR>risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the <BR>risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond <BR>age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo <BR>in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders <BR>are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all <BR>ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately <BR>and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality or unusual changes in <BR>behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close <BR>observation and communication with the prescriber. Fluoxetine is approved for <BR>use in pediatric patients with MDD and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) [see Warnings <BR>and Precautions (5.1) and Use in <BR>Specific Populations (8.4)]. <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        When using fluoxetine and olanzapine in <BR>combination, also refer to Boxed Warning section of the package insert for <BR>Symbyax®.  <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           WARNING: SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT <BR>DRUGS<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           See full prescribing information for complete boxed <BR>warning<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in <BR>children, adolescents and young adults taking antidepressants for major <BR>depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders (5.1).<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              When using fluoxetine and olanzapine in <BR>combination, also refer to Boxed Warning section of the package insert for <BR>Symbyax®. <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
