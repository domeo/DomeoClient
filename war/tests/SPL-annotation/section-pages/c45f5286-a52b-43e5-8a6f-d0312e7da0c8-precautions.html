with a narrow margin of safety.  Therefore, patients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity.  Severe hematological toxicity, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and even death may result from the use of Fluorouracil despite meticulous selection of patients and careful adjustment of dosage.  Although severe toxicity is more likely in poor risk patients, fatalities may be encountered occasionally even in patients in relatively good condition.<BR>                        Therapy is to be discontinued promptly whenever one of the following signs of toxicity appears:<BR>                        Stomatitis or esophagopharyngitis, at the first visible sign.<BR>                        Leukopenia (WBC under 3500) or a rapidly

5-fluorouracil has been associated with the occurrence of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, also known as hand-foot syndrome.  This syndrome has been characterized as a tingling sensation of hands and feet which may progress over the next few days to pain when holding objects or walking.  The palms and soles become symmetrically swollen and erythematous with tenderness of the distal phalanges, possibly accompanied by desquamation.  Interruption of therapy is followed by gradual resolution over 5 to 7 days.  Although pyridoxine has been reported to ameliorate the palmarplantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, its safety and effectiveness have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>

Patients should be informed of expected toxic effects, particularly oral manifestations.  Patients should be alerted to the possibility of alopecia as a result of therapy and should be informed that

<BR>                        <BR>                        Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of fluorouracil have not been conducted.  However, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in small groups of rats given fluorouracil orally at doses of 0.01, 0.3, 1 or 3 mg per rat 5 days per week for 52 weeks, followed by a 6-month observation period.  Also, in other studies, 33 mg/kg of fluorouracil was administered intravenously to male rats once a week for 52 weeks followed by observation for the remainder of their lifetimes with no evidence of carcinogenicity.  Female mice were given 1 mg of fluorouracil intravenously once a week for 16 weeks with no effect on the incidence of lung adenomas.  On the basis of the available data, no evaluation can be made of the carcinogenic risk of fluorouracil to humans.<BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Mutagenesis<BR>

<BR>                        <BR>                        Fluorouracil has not been adequately studied in animals to permit an evaluation of its effects on fertility and general reproductive performance.  However, doses of 125 or 250 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally, have been shown to induce chromosomal aberrations and changes in chromosomal organization of spermatogonia in rats.  Spermatogonial differentiation was also inhibited by fluorouracil, resulting in transient infertility.  However, in studies with a strain of mouse which is sensitive to the induction of sperm head abnormalities after exposure to a range of chemical mutagens and carcinogens, fluorouracil did not produce any abnormalities at oral doses of up to 80 mg/kg/day.  In female rats, fluorouracil, administered intraperitoneally at weekly doses of 25 or 50 mg/kg for 3 weeks during the pre-ovulatory phase of oogenesis, significantly reduced the incidence of fertile matings, delayed the development of pre- and post-implantation embryos, increased the incidence of pre-implantation lethality and induced chromosomal anomalies in these embryos.  In a limited study in rabbits, a single 25 mg/kg dose of fluorouracil or 5 daily doses of 5 mg/kg had no effect on ovulation, appeared not to affect implantation and had only a limited effect in producing zygote destruction.  Compounds such as fluorouracil, which interfere with DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, might be expected to have adverse effects on gametogenesis.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>

for its effects on peri- and postnatal development.  However, fluorouracil has been shown to cross the placenta and enter into fetal circulation in the rat.  Administration of fluorouracil has resulted in increased resorptions and embryolethality in rats.  In monkeys, maternal doses higher than 40 mg/kg resulted in abortion of all embryos exposed to fluorouracil.  Compounds which inhibit DNA, RNA and protein synthesis might be expected to have adverse effects on peri- and postnatal development.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>
