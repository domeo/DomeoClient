When desipramine hydrochloride is substituted for an MAO inhibitor, at least 2 weeks should elapse between treatments. Desipramine hydrochloride should then be started cautiously and should be increased gradually.<BR>                  Desipramine hydrochloride is contraindicated in the acute recovery period following myocardial infarction. It should not be used in those who have shown prior hypersensitivity to the drug. Cross-sensitivity between this and other dibenzazepines is a possibility.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
