A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and Other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for Venlafaxine Extended Release Tablets. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.<BR>                        Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking Venlafaxine Extended Release Tablets.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.1 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.2 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance<BR>                     <BR>                        Clinical studies were performed to examine the effects of venlafaxine on behavioral performance of healthy individuals. The results revealed no clinically significant impairment of psychomotor, cognitive, or complex behavior performance. However, since any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that venlafaxine therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.3 Concomitant Medication<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, including herbal preparations and nutritional supplements, since there is a potential for interactions.<BR>                        Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of Venlafaxine Extended Release Tablets and triptans, tramadol, tryptophan supplements or other serotonergic agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.10)<BR>                           ].<BR>                        Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of Venlafaxine Extended Release Tablets and NSAID's, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) and Drug Interactions (7.11)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.4 Alcohol<BR>                     <BR>                        Although venlafaxine has not been shown to increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking venlafaxine.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.5 Allergic Reactions<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they develop a rash, hives, or a related allergic phenomenon.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.6 Pregnancy<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.7 Nursing<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breast-feeding an infant.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.8 Mydriasis<BR>                     <BR>                        Mydriasis (prolonged dilation of the pupils of the eye) has been reported with venlafaxine.
