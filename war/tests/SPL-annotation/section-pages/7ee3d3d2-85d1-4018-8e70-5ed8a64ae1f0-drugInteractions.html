Where such coadministration exists, careful monitoring of the patient's prothrombin time is recommended.<BR>                        In the NSABP P-1 trial, women who required coumarin-type anticoagulants for any reason were ineligible for participation in the trial (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).<BR>                        There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events occurring when cytotoxic agents are used in combination with tamoxifen.<BR>                        Tamoxifen reduced letrozole plasma concentrations by 37%. The effect of tamoxifen on metabolism and excretion of other antineoplastic drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and other drugs that require mixed function oxidases for activation, is not known. Tamoxifen and N-desmethyl tamoxifen plasma concentrations have been shown to be reduced when coadministered with rifampin or aminoglutethimide. Induction of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism is considered to be the mechanism by which these reductions occur; other CYP3A4 inducing agents have not been studied to confirm this effect.<BR>                        One patient receiving tamoxifen with concomitant phenobarbital exhibited a steady-state serum level of tamoxifen lower than that observed for other patients (i.e., 26 ng/mL vs. mean value of 122 ng/mL). However, the clinical significance of this finding is not known. Rifampin induced the metabolism of tamoxifen and significantly reduced the plasma concentrations of tamoxifen in 10 patients. Aminoglutethimide reduces tamoxifen and N-desmethyl tamoxifen plasma concentrations. Medroxyprogesterone reduces plasma concentrations of N-desmethyl, but not tamoxifen.<BR>                        Concomitant bromocriptine therapy has been shown to elevate serum tamoxifen and N-desmethyl tamoxifen.<BR>                        Based on clinical and pharmacokinetic results from the anastrozole adjuvant trial, tamoxifen should not be administered with anastrozole (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug-drug Interactions).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               </P></DIV></HTML>
