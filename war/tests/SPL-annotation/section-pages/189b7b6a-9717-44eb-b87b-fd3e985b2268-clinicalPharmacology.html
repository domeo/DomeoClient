This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H+, K+)-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours for all doses tested (20Â mg to 120 mg). <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics<BR>                     <BR>                        PROTONIX (pantoprazole sodium) For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension, 40 mg has been shown to be comparable to PROTONIX (pantoprazole sodium) Delayed-Release Tablets in suppressing pentagastrin-stimulated MAO in patients (n = 49) with GERD and a history of EE. In this multicenter, pharmacodynamic crossover study, a 40 mg oral dose of PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension administered in a teaspoonful of applesauce was compared with a 40 mg oral dose of PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets after administration of each formulation once daily for 7 days. Both medications were administered thirty minutes before breakfast. Pentagastrin-stimulated (MAO) was assessed from hour 23 to 24 at steady state. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Antisecretory Activity<BR>                           <BR>                              Under maximal acid stimulatory conditions using pentagastrin, a dose-dependent decrease in gastric acid output occurs after a single dose of oral (20-80 mg) or a single dose of intravenous (20-120 mg) pantoprazole in healthy volunteers. Pantoprazole given once daily results in increasing inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Following the initial oral dose of 40 mg pantoprazole, a 51% mean inhibition was achieved by 2.5 hours. With once-a-day dosing for 7 days, the mean inhibition was increased to 85%. Pantoprazole suppressed acid secretion in excess of 95% in half of the subjects. Acid secretion had returned to normal within a week after the last dose of pantoprazole; there was no evidence of rebound hypersecretion. <BR>                              In a series of dose-response studies, pantoprazole, at oral doses ranging from 20 to 120 mg, caused dose-related increases in median basal gastric pH and in the percent of time gastric pH was > 3 and > 4. Treatment with 40 mg of pantoprazole produced significantly greater increases in gastric pH than the 20 mg dose. Doses higher than 40 mg (60, 80, 120 mg) did not result in further significant increases in median gastric pH. The effects of pantoprazole on median pH from one double-blind crossover study are shown in Table 4. <BR>                              <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" border="1" ID="id_78cc664a-c467-4e0d-b29a-bf635d88a9cf"><BR>                                 <caption ID="id_24436388-f014-45dd-b409-bfa52dcc6121">Table 4: Effect of Single Daily Doses of Oral Pantoprazole on Intragastric pH </caption><BR>                                 <col width="160px"/><BR>                                 <col width="136px"/><BR>                                 <col width="108px"/><BR>                                 <col width="108px"/><BR>                                 <col width="108px"/><BR>                                 <thead><BR>                                    <tr ID="id_5920a731-042d-4f2a-bba5-fe2af53c700e" styleCode="Toprule"><BR>                                       <td align="center" valign="bottom" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">&#160;</td><BR>                                       <td align="justify" valign="bottom" colspan="4" styleCode="Lrule Botrule"><BR>                                          <content styleCode="bold"> &#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8212;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;Median pH on day 7&#8212;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;</content><BR>                                          <br/><BR>                                       </td><BR>                                    </tr><BR>                                    <tr ID="id_ed34cd64-08fb-4ce4-808d-b207430e7c49" styleCode="Botrule"><BR>                                       <td align="left" valign="middle" styleCode="Rrule">Time </td><BR>                                       <td align="center" valign="bottom" styleCode="Rrule">Placebo </td><BR>                                       <td align="center" valign="bottom" styleCode="Rrule">20&#160;mg </td><BR>                                       <td align="center" valign="bottom" styleCode="Rrule">40&#160;mg </td><BR>                                       <td align="center" valign="bottom">80&#160;mg</td><BR>                                    </tr><BR>                                 </thead><BR>                                 <tfoot ID="id_47320e48-e8d7-4521-b075-0157937bac77"><BR>                                    <tr><BR>                                       <td align="left" valign="top" colspan="5">* Significantly different from placebo<paragraph># Significantly different from 20 mg</paragraph><BR>                                       </td><BR>                                    </tr><BR>                                 </tfoot><BR>                                 <tbody><BR>                                    <tr ID="id_e82289ba-498b-4e46-8ca1-92a787849e99" styleCode="Toprule"><BR>                                       <td align="left" valign="top">8 a.m. -

At 4 weeks of treatment there was an increase in mean gastrin levels of 7%, 35%, and 72% over pretreatment values in the 10, 20, and 40 mg treatment groups, respectively. A similar increase in serum gastrin levels was noted at the 8-week visit with mean increases of 3%, 26%, and 84% for the three pantoprazole dose groups. Median serum gastrin levels remained within normal limits during maintenance therapy with PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets. <BR>                              In long-term international studies involving over 800 patients, a 2- to 3-fold mean increase from the pretreatment fasting serum gastrin level was observed in the initial months of treatment with pantoprazole at doses of 40 mg per day during GERD maintenance studies and 40 mg or higher per day in patients with refractory GERD.

Gastric NE-cell tumors in rats may result from chronic elevation of serum gastrin concentrations. The high density of ECL cells in the rat stomach makes this species highly susceptible to the proliferative effects of elevated gastrin concentrations produced by proton pump inhibitors. However, there were no observed elevations in serum gastrin following the administration of pantoprazole at a dose of 0.5Â mg/kg/day. In a separate study, a gastric NE-cell tumor without concomitant ECL-cell proliferative changes was observed in 1 female rat following 12 months of dosing with pantoprazole at 5 mg/kg/day and a 9 month off-dose recovery [see Nonclinical Toxicology (<BR>                                 <BR>                                    13.1)]. <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets are prepared as enteric-coated tablets so that absorption of pantoprazole begins only after the tablet leaves the stomach. Peak serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) increase in a manner proportional to oral and intravenous doses from 10 mg to 80 mg. Pantoprazole does not accumulate, and its pharmacokinetics are unaltered with multiple daily dosing. Following oral or intravenous administration, the serum concentration of pantoprazole declines biexponentially, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately one hour. <BR>                        In extensive metabolizers with normal liver function receiving an oral dose of the enteric-coated 40 mg pantoprazole tablet, the peak concentration (Cmax) is 2.5 Î¼g/mL; the time to reach the peak concentration (tmax) is 2.5 h, and the mean total area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) is 4.8 Î¼gâ¢h/mL (range 1.4 to 13.3 Î¼gâ¢h/mL). Following intravenous administration of pantoprazole to extensive metabolizers, its total clearance is 7.6â14.0 L/h, and its apparent volume of distribution is 11.0â23.6 L.<BR>                        A single oral dose of PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension, 40 mg, was shown to be bioequivalent when administered to healthy subjects (N = 22) as granules sprinkled over a teaspoonful of applesauce, as granules mixed with apple juice, or mixed with apple juice followed by administration through a nasogastric tube.

Pantoprazole undergoes little first-pass metabolism, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 77%. Pantoprazole absorption is not affected by concomitant administration of antacids.<BR>                              Administration of PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets with food may delay its absorption up to 2 hours or longer; however, the Cmax and the extent of pantoprazole absorption (AUC) are not altered. Thus, PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets may be taken without regard to timing of meals.<BR>                              Administration of pantoprazole granules, 40 mg, with a high-fat meal delayed median time to peak plasma concentration by 2 hours. With a concomitant high-fat meal, the Cmax and AUC of pantoprazole granules, 40 mg, sprinkled on applesauce decreased by 51% and 29%, respectively. Thus, PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension should be taken approximately 30 minutes before a meal. <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Distribution<BR>                           <BR>                              The apparent volume of distribution of pantoprazole is approximately 11.0-23.6 L, distributing mainly in extracellular fluid.

Pantoprazole metabolism is independent of the route of administration (intravenous or oral). The main metabolic pathway is demethylation, by CYP2C19, with subsequent sulfation; other metabolic pathways include oxidation by CYP3A4.

Although serum half-life values increased to 7-9 hours and AUC values increased by 5- to 7âfold in hepatic-impaired patients, these increases were no greater than those observed in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, where no dosage adjustment is warranted. These pharmacokinetic changes in hepatic-impaired patients result in minimal drug accumulation following once-daily, multiple-dose administration. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment. Doses higher than 40 mg/day have not been studied in hepatically impaired patients. <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Drug-Drug Interactions <BR>                           <BR>                              Pantoprazole is metabolized mainly by CYP2C19 and to minor extents by CYPs 3A4, 2D6, and 2C9. In in vivo drug-drug interaction studies with CYP2C19 substrates (diazepam [also a CYP3A4 substrate] and phenytoin [also a CYP3A4 inducer]), nifedipine, midazolam, and clarithromycin (CYP3A4 substrates), metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate), diclofenac, naproxen and piroxicam (CYP2C9 substrates), and theophylline (a CYP1A2 substrate) in healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole were not significantly altered. <BR>                              <BR>                                 In vivo studies also suggest that pantoprazole does not significantly affect the kinetics of the following drugs (cisapride, theophylline, diazepam [and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam], phenytoin, warfarin, metoprolol, nifedipine, carbamazepine, midazolam, clarithromycin, naproxen, piroxicam, and oral contraceptives [levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol]).

Although these subpopulations of pantoprazole poor metabolizers have elimination half-life values of 3.5 to 10.0 hours in adults, they still have minimal accumulation (â¤ 23%) with once-daily dosing.
