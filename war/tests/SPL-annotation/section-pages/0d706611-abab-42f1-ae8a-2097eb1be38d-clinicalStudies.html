Patients had a Karnofsky performance status of at least 60%, a granulocyte count of 1,500 cells/mm3, a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3, less than or equal to 25% of the intra-trabecular marrow space involved by lymphoma, and no evidence of progressive disease arising in a field irradiated with >3,500 cGy within one year of completion of irradiation. <BR>                  This study enrolled 40 patients with low-grade or transformed low-grade or follicular large-cell lymphoma whose disease had not responded to, or had progressed following, at least 4 doses of rituximab therapy. The median age was 57 years (range: 35 to 78 years); the median time from diagnosis to protocol entry was 50 months (range: 12 to 170 months); and the median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 4 (range: 1 to 11). Overall, 35 of the 40 patients were rituximab-refractory (defined as no response or a response of less than 6 months’ duration following rituximab therapy).  <BR>                  The main outcome measure in Study was overall response rate as determined by an independent panel that reviewed patient records and radiologic studies (Table 6).<BR>                  <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ID="_RefID0EDZBG"><BR>                     <caption>Table 6.
