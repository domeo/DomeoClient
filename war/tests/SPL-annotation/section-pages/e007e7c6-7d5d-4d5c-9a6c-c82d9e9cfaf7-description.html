These agents are competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme catalyzing the early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate.<BR>                  Pravastatin sodium USP is designated chemically as 1-Naphthalene-heptanoic acid, 1,2,6,7,8,8a-hexahydro-b,d,6-trihydroxy-2-methyl-8-(2-methyl-1-oxobutoxy)-, monosodium salt,[1S-[1a (bS*,dS*),2a,6a,8b(R*),8aa]]-.

It is a relatively polar hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient (octanol/water) of 0.59 at a pH of 7.0. It is soluble in methanol and water (>300 mg/mL), slightly soluble in isopropanol, and practically insoluble in acetone, acetonitrile, chloroform, and ether. <BR>                  Pravastatin sodium tablets USP are available for oral administration as 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg or 80 mg tablets. Inactive ingredients include: croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, meglumine, microcelac 100 (lactose monohydrate and microcrystalline cellulose), microcrystalline cellulose, opadry white YS-1-7040 (hypromellose 2910, polyethylene glycol 8000, talc, and titanium dioxide). <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     Structural Formula<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
