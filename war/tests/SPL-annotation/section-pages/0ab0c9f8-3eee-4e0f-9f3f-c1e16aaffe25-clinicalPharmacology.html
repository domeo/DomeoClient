The CFTR protein is a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. Ivacaftor facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel-open probability (or gating) of the G551D-CFTR protein. <BR>                        In vitro, ivacaftor increased CFTR-mediated transepithelial current (IT) in rodent cells expressing G551D-CFTR protein following addition of a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) agonist with an EC50 of 100 ± 47 nM; however, ivacaftor did not increase IT in the absence of cAMP agonist. Ivacaftor also increased IT in human bronchial epithelial cells expressing G551D-CFTR protein following addition of a cAMP agonist by 10-fold with an EC50 of 236 ±200 nM. Ivacaftor increased the open probability of G551D-CFTR protein in single channel patch clamp experiments using membrane patches from rodent cells expressing G551D-CFTR protein by 6-fold versus untreated cells after addition of PKA and ATP.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Sweat Chloride Evaluation<BR>                              <BR>                              In clinical trials in patients with the G551D mutation in the CFTR gene, KALYDECO led to statistically significant reductions in sweat chloride concentration. In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (one in patients 12 and older and the other in patients 6-11 years of age), the mean change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -48 mmol/L (95% CI -51, -45) and -54 mmol/L (95% CI -62, -47) respectively. These changes persisted through 48 weeks. There was no direct correlation between decrease in sweat chloride levels and improvement in lung function (FEV1). <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 ECG Evaluation<BR>                              <BR>                              The effect of multiple doses of ivacaftor 150 mg and 450 mg twice daily on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) four-period crossover thorough QT study in 72 healthy subjects. In a study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on Fridericia's correction method (QTcF) was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        The pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor is similar between healthy adult volunteers and patients with CF.<BR>                        After oral administration of a single 150 mg dose to healthy volunteers in a fed state, peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) occurred at approximately 4 hours, and the mean (±SD) for AUC and Cmax were 10600 (5260) ng*hr/mL and 768 (233) ng/mL, respectively. <BR>                        After every 12 hour dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of ivacaftor were reached by days 3 to 5, with an accumulation ratio ranging from 2.2 to 2.9.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Absorption<BR>                              <BR>                              The exposure of ivacaftor increased approximately 2- to 4-fold when given with food containing fat. Therefore, KALYDECO should be administered with fat-containing food. Examples of fat-containing foods include eggs, butter, peanut butter, and cheese pizza. The median (range) tmax is approximately 4.0 (3.0; 6.0) hours in the fed state.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Distribution<BR>                              <BR>                              Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells.<BR>                              The mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of ivacaftor after a single dose of 275 mg of KALYDECO in the fed state was similar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. After oral administration of 150 mg every 12 hours for 7 days to healthy volunteers in a fed state, the mean (±SD) for apparent volume of distribution was 353 (122) L. <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Metabolism<BR>                              <BR>                              Ivacaftor is extensively metabolized in humans. In vitro and clinical studies indicate that ivacaftor is primarily metabolized by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Elimination<BR>                              <BR>                              Following oral administration, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the feces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for approximately 65% of the total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately 12 hours following a single dose. The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was similar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The CL/F (SD) for the 150 mg dose was 17.3 (8.4) L/hr in healthy subjects.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Special populations<BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       Hepatic impairment<BR>                                    <BR>                                    Patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had similar ivacaftor Cmax, but an approximately two-fold increase in ivacaftor AUC0-∞ compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Therefore, a reduced KALYDECO dose of 150 mg once daily is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The impact of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) on pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor has not been studied, but the increase in ivacaftor AUC0-∞ is expected to be less than two-fold. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. The impact of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15) on pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor has not been studied. The magnitude of increase in exposure in these patients is unknown but is expected to be substantially higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. When benefits are expected to outweigh the risks, KALYDECO should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment at a dose of 150 mg given once daily or less frequently.<BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       Renal impairment<BR>                                    <BR>                                    KALYDECO has not been studied in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or in patients with end stage renal disease. No dose adjustments are recommended for mild and moderate renal impairment patients because of minimal elimination of ivacaftor and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine in a human PK study); however, caution is recommended when administering KALYDECO to patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease.<BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       Gender<BR>                                    <BR>                                    The effect of gender on KALYDECO pharmacokinetics was evaluated using population pharmacokinetics of data from clinical studies of KALYDECO.

Metabolite M1, but not M6, also has potential to inhibit CYP3A and P-gp. Ivacaftor, M1, and M6 were not inducers of CYP isozymes.
