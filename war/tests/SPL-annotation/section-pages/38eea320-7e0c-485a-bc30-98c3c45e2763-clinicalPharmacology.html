Vemurafenib also inhibits other kinases in vitro such as CRAF, ARAF, wild-type BRAF, SRMS, ACK1, MAP4K5 and FGR at similar concentrations.  Some mutations in the BRAF gene including V600E result in constitutively activated BRAF proteins, which can cause cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors that would normally be required for proliferation. Vemurafenib has anti-tumor effects in cellular and animal models of melanomas with mutated BRAFV600E.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        The pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib were determined in patients with BRAF mutation-positive metastatic melanoma following 15 days of dosing at 960 mg twice daily with dosing approximately 12 hours apart.  The population pharmacokinetic analysis pooled data from 458 patients.  A one-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination adequately describes the vemurafenib concentration-time profile. At steady state, vemurafenib exhibits linear pharmacokinetics within the 240 mg to 960 mg dose range. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Absorption<BR>                              <BR>                              The bioavailability of vemurafenib has not been determined. Following oral administration of vemurafenib at 960 mg twice daily for 15 days to patients with metastatic melanoma, the median Tmax was approximately 3 hours.<BR>                              Following 15 days of dosing at 960 mg twice daily, the mean (± SD) Cmax and AUC0-12 were 62 µg/mL ± 17 and 601 ± 170 µg*h/mL, respectively. The median accumulation ratio estimate from the population pharmacokinetic analysis for the twice daily regimen is 7.36, with steady state achieved at approximately 15 to 22 days following dosing at 960 mg twice daily. At steady state, the mean vemurafenib exposure in plasma is stable (concentrations before and 2-4 hours after the morning dose) as indicated by the mean ratio of 1.13.<BR>                              The potential effect of food on vemurafenib absorption has not been studied.

The population apparent clearance of vemurafenib in patients with metastatic melanoma is estimated to be 31 L/day (with 32% inter-patient variability).  The median of the individual elimination half-life estimates for vemurafenib is 57 hours (the 5th and 95th percentile range is 30 to 120 hours).<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations<BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib were examined in patients with metastatic melanoma enrolled in the clinical trials with normal hepatic function (n=158, total bilirubin ≤ ULN) and pre-existing mild (n=58, total bilirubin 1.0-1.5 × ULN), moderate (n=27, total bilirubin 1.5-3 × ULN), or severe (n=3, total bilirubin > 3 × ULN) hepatic impairment.

Coadministration of vemurafenib increased the AUC of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) 2.6-fold and increased the Cmax and AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) by 36% and 47%, respectively, while it decreased the Cmax and AUC of midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) by 35% and 39%, respectively.  Coadministration of vemurafenib increased the AUC of S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) by 18%. Coadministration of vemurafenib did not change the systemic exposure to omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. <BR>                                    <BR>                                    <BR>                                       In vitro studies have demonstrated that vemurafenib is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp).<BR>                                    <BR>                                       In vitro studies with human hepatic microsomes showed that vemurafenib is a CYP3A4 substrate.
