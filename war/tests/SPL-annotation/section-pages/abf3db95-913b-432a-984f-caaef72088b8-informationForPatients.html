Patients should be informed that the omeprazole delayed-release capsules should be swallowed whole. <BR>                  For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, the contents of an omeprazole delayed-release capsule can be added to applesauce. One tablespoon of applesauce should be added to an empty bowl and the capsule should be opened. All of the pellets inside the capsule should be carefully emptied on the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately with a glass of cool water to ensure complete swallowing of the pellets. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The pellets/applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use. <BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
