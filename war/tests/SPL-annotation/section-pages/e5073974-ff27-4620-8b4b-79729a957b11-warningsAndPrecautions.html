Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.<BR>                        The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" border="single" width="425" ID="id_d1086b33-6ffc-47a4-afbb-6f044296c6e8"><BR>                           <caption ID="id_40679549-5107-40f5-b47c-4c44f3e24819">TABLE 1: DRUG-PLACEBO DIFFERENCES IN NUMBER OF CASES OF SUICIDALITY PER 1000 PATIENTS TREATED</caption><BR>                           <col width="41.1%"/><BR>                           <col width="59.0%"/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr ID="id_3fb75fe5-d022-4c88-a950-faca59d3c325"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Toprule Rrule Lrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Age Range</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Increases Compared to Placebo</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_7ab33c66-ad86-44e2-b3da-e60e77e04d2b"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">&lt; 18</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">14 ADDITIONAL CASES</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_e78082a9-4a10-487c-b2eb-81c536be20e3"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">18 to 24</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">5 ADDITIONAL CASES</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_1a1ec7b0-ae14-43f7-b49d-166cc4b5e93f"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Age Range</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Decreases Compared to Placebo</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_e7d52a69-353b-4171-8589-b5fb411c30d7"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">25 to 64</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">1 FEWER CASE</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_b90265ce-dedd-4c26-9cde-9e7ac500d708"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">&#8805; 65</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">6 FEWER CASES</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR> No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about the drug effect on suicide.<BR>                        It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.<BR>                        <BR>                           All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.<BR>                        <BR>                        The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.<BR>                        Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.<BR>                        If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions, Discontinuation of Treatment With Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets (5.9), for a description of the risks of discontinuation of fluvoxamine maleate tablets].<BR>                        <BR>                           Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions  for fluvoxamine maleate tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent  with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.<BR>                        <BR>                           Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder<BR>                        <BR>                        A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that fluvoxamine maleate tablets are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.2 Potential for Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Interaction<BR>                     <BR>                        In patients receiving another serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma. These reactions have also been reported in patients who have discontinued that drug and have been started on an MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling a serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Therefore, fluvoxamine maleate tablets should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping fluvoxamine maleate tablets before starting an MAOI [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Contraindications     (4)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.3 Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-Like Reactions<BR>                     <BR>                        The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including fluvoxamine maleate tablets treatment, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.<BR>                        The concomitant use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets with MAOIs intended to treat depression is contraindicated.<BR>                        If concomitant treatment of fluvoxamine maleate tablets with a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist (triptan) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.<BR>                        The concomitant use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets with serotonin precursors (such as tryptophan) is not recommended.<BR>                        Treatment with fluvoxamine maleate tablets and any concomitant serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.4 Potential Thioridazine Interaction<BR>                     <BR>                        The effect of fluvoxamine (25 mg b.i.d. for one week) on thioridazine steady state concentrations was evaluated in 10 male inpatients with schizophrenia. Concentrations of thioridazine and its two active metabolites, mesoridazine and sulforidazine, increased threefold following coadministration of fluvoxamine.<BR>                        Thioridazine administration produces a dose-related prolongation of the QTc interval, which is associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsade de pointes-type arrhythmias, and sudden death. It is likely that this experience underestimates the degree of risk that might occur with higher doses of thioridazine. Moreover, the effect of fluvoxamine may be even more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses.<BR>                        Therefore, fluvoxamine and thioridazine should not be coadministered [see Contraindications     (4)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.5 Potential Tizanidine Interaction<BR>                     <BR>                        Fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 and tizanidine is a CYP1A2 substrate. The effect of fluvoxamine (100 mg daily for 4 days) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine has been studied in 10 healthy male subjects. Tizanidine Cmax was increased approximately 12 fold (range 5 fold to 32 fold), elimination half-life was increased by almost 3 fold, and AUC increased 33 fold (range 14 fold to 103 fold). The mean maximal effect on blood pressure was a 35 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure, a 20 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure, and a 4 beat/min decrease in heart rate. Drowsiness was significantly increased and performance on the psychomotor task was significantly impaired. Fluvoxamine and tizanidine should not be used together [see Contraindications (4)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.6 Potential Pimozide Interaction<BR>                     <BR>                        Pimozide is metabolized by the cytochrome P4503A4 isoenzyme, and it has been demonstrated that ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, blocks the metabolism of this drug, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug. An increased plasma concentration of pimozide causes QT prolongation and has been associated with torsade de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia, sometimes fatal. As noted below, a substantial pharmacokinetic interaction has been observed for fluvoxamine in combination with alprazolam, a drug that is known to be metabolized by CYP3A4. Although it has not been definitively demonstrated that fluvoxamine is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, it is likely to be, given the substantial interaction of fluvoxamine with alprazolam. Consequently, it is recommended that fluvoxamine not be used in combination with pimozide [see Contraindications (<BR>                                 4<BR>                              )].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.7 Potential Alosetron Interaction<BR>                     <BR>                        Because alosetron is metabolized by a variety of hepatic CYP drug metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance of alosetron. Fluvoxamine is a known potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 and also inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. In a pharmacokinetic study, 40 healthy female subjects received fluvoxamine in escalating doses from 50 mg to 200 mg a day for 16 days, with coadministration of alosetron 1 mg on the last day. Fluvoxamine increased mean alosetron plasma concentration (AUC) approximately 6 fold and prolonged the half-life by approximately 3 fold [s<BR>                           ee Contraindications (<BR>                                 4<BR>                              )  and LotronexTM (alosetron) package insert].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.8 Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Benzodiazepines<BR>                        <BR>                        Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam, etc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by fluvoxamine. The clearance of benzodiazepines metabolized by glucuronidation (e.g., lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam) is unlikely to be affected by fluvoxamine.<BR>                        <BR>                           Alprazolam<BR>                        <BR>                        When fluvoxamine maleate (100 mg q.d.) and alprazolam (1 mg q.i.d.) were coadministered to steady state, plasma concentrations and other pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax, T½) of alprazolam were approximately twice those observed when alprazolam was administered alone; oral clearance was reduced by about 50%. The elevated plasma alprazolam concentrations resulted in decreased psychomotor performance and memory. This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is coadministered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100 to 300 mg. If alprazolam is coadministered with fluvoxamine maleate tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended. No dosage adjustment is required for fluvoxamine maleate tablets.<BR>                        <BR>                           Diazepam<BR>                        <BR>                        The coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and diazepam is generally not advisable. Because fluvoxamine reduces the clearance of both diazepam and its active metabolite, N-desmethyldiazepam, there is a strong likelihood of substantial accumulation of both species during chronic coadministration.<BR>                        Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to coadminister fluvoxamine and diazepam is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam. In these subjects (N = 8), the clearance of diazepam was reduced by 65% and that of N-desmethyldiazepam to a level that was too low to measure over the course of the 2 week long study.<BR>                        It is likely that this experience significantly underestimates the degree of accumulation that might occur with repeated diazepam administration. Moreover, as noted with alprazolam, the effect of fluvoxamine may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses.<BR>                        Accordingly, diazepam and fluvoxamine should not ordinarily be coadministered.<BR>                        <BR>                           Clozapine<BR>                        <BR>                        Elevated serum levels of clozapine have been reported in patients taking fluvoxamine maleate and clozapine. Since clozapine-related seizures and orthostatic hypotension appear to be dose related, the risk of these adverse events may be higher when fluvoxamine and clozapine are coadministered. Patients should be closely monitored when fluvoxamine maleate and clozapine are used concurrently.<BR>                        <BR>                           Methadone<BR>                        <BR>                        Significantly increased methadone (plasma level:dose) ratios have been reported when fluvoxamine maleate was administered to patients receiving maintenance methadone treatment, with symptoms of opioid intoxication in one patient.

The clearance of mexiletine was reduced by 38% following coadministration with fluvoxamine compared to mexiletine alone. If fluvoxamine and mexiletine are coadministered, serum mexiletine levels should be monitored.<BR>                        <BR>                           Ramelteon<BR>                        <BR>                        When fluvoxamine 100 mg twice daily was administered for 3 days prior to single-dose coadministration of ramelteon 16 mg and fluvoxamine, the AUC for ramelteon increased approximately 190 fold and the Cmax increased approximately 70 fold compared to ramelteon administered alone. Ramelteon should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine.<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Theophylline<BR>                        <BR>                        The effect of steady state fluvoxamine (50 mg bid) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of theophylline (375 mg as 442 mg aminophylline) was evaluated in 12 healthy non-smoking, male volunteers. The clearance of theophylline was decreased approximately 3 fold. Therefore, if theophylline is coadministered with fluvoxamine maleate, its dose should be reduced to one-third of the usual daily maintenance dose and plasma concentrations of theophylline should be monitored. No dosage adjustment is required for fluvoxamine maleate tablets.<BR>                        <BR>                           Warfarin and Other Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, etc.)<BR>                        <BR>                        Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the  case-control and cohort design have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs  that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These  studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of  bleeding. Thus, patients should be cautioned about the use of such drugs concurrently with  fluvoxamine [see Warnings and Precautions, Abnormal Bleeding (5.10)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Warfarin<BR>                        <BR>                        When fluvoxamine maleate (50 mg t.i.d.) was administered concomitantly with warfarin for two weeks, warfarin plasma concentrations increased by 98% and prothrombin times were prolonged. Thus patients receiving oral anticoagulants and fluvoxamine maleate tablets should have their prothrombin time monitored and their anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly.

While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.<BR>                        Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with fluvoxamine maleate tablets. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.10 Abnormal Bleeding<BR>                     <BR>                        SSRIs and SNRIs, including fluvoxamine maleate tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.<BR>                        Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation [see section 5.8].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.11 Activation of Mania/Hypomania<BR>                     <BR>                        During premarketing studies involving primarily depressed patients, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated with fluvoxamine. In a ten week pediatric OCD study, 2 out of 57 patients (4%) treated with fluvoxamine experienced manic reactions, compared to none of 63 placebo patients. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with other marketed antidepressants. As with all antidepressants, fluvoxamine maleate tablets should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.12 Seizures<BR>                     <BR>                        During premarketing studies, seizures were reported in 0.2% of fluvoxamine-treated patients.

In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs [see Use in Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5)]. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk. Discontinuation of fluvoxamine maleate tablets should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.<BR>                        Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls.
