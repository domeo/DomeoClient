Aromatase is <BR>the principal enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens both in pre- and <BR>postmenopausal women. While the main source of estrogen (primarily estradiol) is <BR>the ovary in premenopausal women, the principal source of circulating estrogens <BR>in postmenopausal women is from conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens <BR>(androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) by the <BR>aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase <BR>inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for some postmenopausal <BR>patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer.<BR>                  Exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator, structurally <BR>related to the natural substrate androstenedione. It acts as a false substrate <BR>for the aromatase enzyme, and is processed to an intermediate that binds <BR>irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme causing its inactivation, an <BR>effect also known as "suicide inhibition." Exemestane significantly lowers <BR>circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women, but has no <BR>detectable effect on adrenal biosynthesis of corticosteroids or aldosterone. <BR>Exemestane has no effect on other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway <BR>up to a concentration at least 600 times higher than that inhibiting the <BR>aromatase enzyme.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  PharmacokineticsFollowing oral administration to healthy postmenopausal women, <BR>exemestane is rapidly absorbed. After maximum plasma concentration is reached, <BR>levels decline polyexponentially with a mean terminal half-life of about 24 <BR>hours. Exemestane is extensively distributed and is cleared from the systemic <BR>circulation primarily by metabolism. The pharmacokinetics of exemestane are dose <BR>proportional after single (10 to 200 mg) or repeated oral doses (0.5 to 50 mg). <BR>Following repeated daily doses of exemestane 25 mg, plasma concentrations of <BR>unchanged drug are similar to levels measured after a single dose.<BR>                  Pharmacokinetic parameters in postmenopausal women with advanced breast <BR>cancer following single or repeated doses have been compared with those in <BR>healthy, postmenopausal women. Exemestane appeared to be more rapidly absorbed <BR>in the women with breast cancer than in the healthy women, with a mean tmax of 1.2 hours in the women with breast cancer and 2.9 hours <BR>in the healthy women. After repeated dosing, the average oral clearance in women <BR>with advanced breast cancer was 45% lower than the oral clearance in healthy <BR>postmenopausal women, with corresponding higher systemic exposure. Mean AUC <BR>values following repeated doses in women with breast cancer (75.4 ng∙h/mL) were <BR>about twice those in healthy women (41.4 ng∙h/mL). <BR>                  <BR>                  AbsorptionFollowing oral administration of radiolabeled exemestane, at <BR>least 42% of radioactivity was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. <BR>Exemestane plasma levels increased by approximately 40% after a high-fat <BR>breakfast. <BR>                  <BR>                  DistributionExemestane is distributed extensively into tissues. Exemestane is <BR>90% bound to plasma proteins and the fraction bound is independent of the total <BR>concentration. Albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein both <BR>contribute to the binding. The distribution of exemestane and its metabolites <BR>into blood cells is negligible. <BR>                  <BR>                  Metabolism and ExcretionFollowing administration of radiolabeled exemestane to healthy <BR>postmenopausal women, the cumulative amounts of radioactivity excreted in urine <BR>and feces were similar (42 ± 3% in urine and 42 ± 6% in feces over a 1-week <BR>collection period). The amount of drug excreted unchanged in urine was less than <BR>1% of the dose. Exemestane is extensively metabolized, with levels of the <BR>unchanged drug in plasma accounting for less than 10% of the total <BR>radioactivity. The initial steps in the metabolism of exemestane are oxidation <BR>of the methylene group in position 6 and reduction of the 17-keto group with <BR>subsequent formation of many secondary metabolites. Each metabolite accounts <BR>only for a limited amount of drug-related material. The metabolites are inactive <BR>or inhibit aromatase with decreased potency compared with the parent drug. One <BR>metabolite may have androgenic activity (see Pharmacodynamics, Other Endocrine Effects). <BR>Studies using human liver preparations indicate that cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP <BR>3A4) is the principal isoenzyme involved in the oxidation of exemestane. <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  Special Populations <BR>                  GeriatricHealthy postmenopausal women aged 43 to 68 years were studied in <BR>the pharmacokinetic trials. Age-related alterations in exemestane <BR>pharmacokinetics were not seen over this age range.<BR>                  <BR>                  GenderThe pharmacokinetics of exemestane following administration of a <BR>single, 25-mg tablet to fasted healthy males (mean age 32 years) were similar to <BR>the pharmacokinetics of exemestane in fasted healthy postmenopausal women (mean <BR>age 55 years).<BR>                  <BR>                  RaceThe influence of race on exemestane pharmacokinetics has not been <BR>evaluated.<BR>                  <BR>                  Hepatic InsufficiencyThe pharmacokinetics of exemestane have been investigated in <BR>subjects with moderate or severe hepatic insufficiency (Childs-Pugh B or C). <BR>Following a single 25-mg oral dose, the AUC of exemestane was approximately 3 <BR>times higher than that observed in healthy volunteers (see PRECAUTIONS). <BR>                  <BR>                  Renal InsufficiencyThe AUC of exemestane after a single 25-mg dose was approximately <BR>3 times higher in subjects with moderate or severe renal insufficiency <BR>(creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared <BR>with the AUC in healthy volunteers (see PRECAUTIONS).<BR>                  <BR>                  PediatricThe pharmacokinetics of exemestane have not been studied in <BR>pediatric patients.<BR>                  <BR>                  Drug-Drug InteractionsExemestane is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) and <BR>aldoketoreductases. It does not inhibit any of the major CYP isoenzymes, <BR>including CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In a clinical pharmacokinetic study, <BR>ketoconazole showed no significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of <BR>exemestane. Although no other formal drug-drug interaction studies have been <BR>conducted, significant effects on exemestane clearance by CYP isoenzymes <BR>inhibitors appear unlikely. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study of 10 healthy <BR>postmenopausal volunteers pretreated with potent CYP 3A4 inducer rifampicin 600 <BR>mg daily for 14 days followed by a single dose of exemestane 25 mg, the mean <BR>plasma Cmax and AUC 0–∞ of <BR>exemestane were decreased by 41% and 54%, respectively (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND <BR>ADMINISTRATION).<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  Pharmacodynamics<BR>                  Effect on EstrogensMultiple doses of exemestane ranging from 0.5 to 600 mg/day were <BR>administered to postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Plasma <BR>estrogen (estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate) suppression was seen starting <BR>at a 5-mg daily dose of exemestane, with a maximum suppression of at least 85% <BR>to 95% achieved at a 25-mg dose. Exemestane 25 mg daily reduced whole body <BR>aromatization (as measured by injecting radiolabeled androstenedione) by 98% in <BR>postmenopausal women with breast cancer. After a single dose of exemestane 25 <BR>mg, the maximal suppression of circulating estrogens occurred 2 to 3 days after <BR>dosing and persisted for 4 to 5 days.<BR>                  <BR>                  Effect on CorticosteroidsIn multiple-dose trials of doses up to 200 mg daily, exemestane <BR>selectivity was assessed by examining its effect on adrenal steroids. Exemestane <BR>did not affect cortisol or aldosterone secretion at baseline or in response to <BR>ACTH at any dose. Thus, no glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid replacement <BR>therapy is necessary with exemestane treatment.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  Other Endocrine EffectsExemestane does not bind significantly to steroidal receptors, <BR>except for a slight affinity for the androgen receptor (0.28% relative to <BR>dihydrotestosterone). The binding affinity of its 17-dihydrometabolite for the <BR>androgen receptor, however, is 100-times that of the parent compound. Daily <BR>doses of exemestane up to 25 mg had no significant effect on circulating levels <BR>of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, or 17-hydroxyprogesterone, <BR>and were associated with small decreases in circulating levels of testosterone. <BR>Increases in testosterone and androstenedione levels have been observed at daily <BR>doses of 200 mg or more. A dose-dependent decrease in sex hormone binding <BR>globulin (SHBG) has been observed with daily exemestane doses of 2.5 mg or <BR>higher. Slight, nondose-dependent increases in serum luteinizing hormone (LH) <BR>and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels have been observed even at low <BR>doses as a consequence of feedback at the pituitary level. Exemestane 25 mg <BR>daily had no significant effect on thyroid function [free triiodothyronine <BR>(FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)]. <BR>                  <BR>                  Coagulation and Lipid EffectsIn study 027 of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer <BR>treated with exemestane (N=73) or placebo (N=73), there was no change in the <BR>coagulation parameters activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT], prothrombin <BR>time [PT] and fibrinogen. Plasma HDL cholesterol was decreased 6–9% in <BR>exemestane treated patients; total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, <BR>apolipoprotein-A1, apolipoprotein-B, and lipoprotein-a were unchanged. An 18% <BR>increase in homocysteine levels was also observed in exemestane treated patients <BR>compared with a 12% increase seen with placebo.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
