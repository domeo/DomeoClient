Since the maximal effect of a given dose is seen within 4 weeks, periodic lipid determinations should be performed at this time and dosage adjusted according to the patientâ€™s response to therapy and established treatment guidelines.<BR>                  <BR>                     Adult Patients<BR>                  <BR>                  The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. If a daily dose of 40 mg does not achieve desired cholesterol levels, 80 mg once daily is recommended. In patients with a history of significant renal or hepatic dysfunction, a starting dose of 10 mg daily is recommended.<BR>                  <BR>                     Pediatric Patients<BR>                  <BR>                  Children (Ages 8 to 13 Years, Inclusive)<BR>                  The recommended dose is 20 mg once daily in children 8 to 13 years of age. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population.<BR>                  Adolescents (Ages 14 to 18 Years)<BR>                  The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily in adolescents 14 to 18 years of age. Doses greater than 40 mg have not been studied in this patient population.<BR>                  Children and adolescents treated with pravastatin should be re-evaluated in adulthood and appropriate changes made to their cholesterol-lowering regimen to achieve adult goals for LDL-C (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE, Hyperlipidemia, NCEP Treatment Guidelines).<BR>                  In patients taking immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine (see WARNINGS: Skeletal Muscle) concomitantly with pravastatin, therapy should begin with 10 mg of pravastatin sodium once-a-day at bedtime and titration to higher doses should be done with caution. Most patients treated with this combination received a maximum pravastatin dose of 20 mg/day.<BR>                  <BR>                     Concomitant Therapy<BR>                  <BR>                  The lipid-lowering effects of pravastatin on total and LDL-cholesterol are enhanced when combined with a bile-acid-binding resin. When administering a bile-acid-binding resin (e.g., cholestyramine, colestipol) and pravastatin, pravastatin should be given either 1 hour or more before or at least 4 hours following the resin.
