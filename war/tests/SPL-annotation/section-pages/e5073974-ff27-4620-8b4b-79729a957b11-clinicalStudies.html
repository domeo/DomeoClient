Patients in these trials were titrated to a total daily fluvoxamine maleate dose of 150 mg/day over the first two weeks of the trial, following which the dose was adjusted within a range of 100 to 300 mg/day (on a b.i.d. schedule), on the basis of response and tolerance. Patients in these studies had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III-R), with mean baseline ratings on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), total score of 23. Patients receiving fluvoxamine maleate experienced mean reductions of approximately 4 to 5 units on the Y-BOCS total score, compared to a 2 unit reduction for placebo patients.<BR>                        <BR>                           Table 6 provides the outcome classification by treatment group on the Global Improvement item of the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale for both studies combined.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" border="single" width="437" ID="id_c3fec7c7-e4f8-419e-b9f9-dd9c5ba562b7"><BR>                           <caption ID="id_4132b6f2-eb27-48f1-b729-8f3e900b81e9">TABLE 6: OUTCOME CLASSIFICATION (%) ON CGI-GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT ITEM FOR COMPLETERS IN POOL OF TWO ADULT OCD STUDIES</caption><BR>                           <col width="33.0%"/><BR>                           <col width="34.0%"/><BR>                           <col width="33.2%"/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr ID="id_6d08b9e1-2858-4456-b86c-1b2268fbf39d"><BR>                                 <td align="justify" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Toprule Rrule Lrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Outcome Classification</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Fluvoxamine (N = 120)</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Placebo (N = 134)</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_d005043f-c0f9-4963-9bb9-42ecc0104cf3"><BR>                                 <td align="justify" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule">Very Much Improved</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">13%</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">2%</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_1b698df3-2b1e-4a06-be15-a2dd30aefd3f"><BR>                                 <td align="justify" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule">Much Improved</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">30%</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">10%</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_6c0208a0-d905-46a0-b87a-a022e4b44750"><BR>                                 <td align="justify" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule">Minimally Improved</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">22%</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">32%</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_3b09d8b9-898a-474c-9e13-a1f8624d86aa"><BR>                                 <td align="justify" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule">No Change</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">31%</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">51%</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_0be02ec8-7e89-47b6-8755-b9ec390913fa"><BR>                                 <td align="justify" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule">Worse</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Rrule">4%</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">6%</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR> <BR>                        Exploratory analyses for age and gender effects on outcomes did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     14.2 Adult OCD Maintenance Study<BR>                     <BR>                        In a maintenance trial of adult outpatients with OCD, 114 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for OCD and with a Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score ≥ 18 were titrated to an effective dose of fluvoxamine maleate tablets 100 to 300 mg/day as part of an initial 10 week single-blind treatment phase. Treatment response during this single-blind phase was defined as Y-BOCS scores at least 30% lower than baseline at the end of weeks 8 and 10. Of the patients who responded, their average duration of response was 4 weeks. Patients who responded during this initial phase were randomized either to continuation of fluvoxamine maleate tablets (N = 56) or to placebo (N = 58) in a double-blind phase for observation of relapse. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase in the Y-BOCS score of at least 30% over the baseline for that phase or patient refusal to continue treatment due to a substantial increase in OCD symptoms. In the double-blind phase, patients receiving continued fluvoxamine maleate tablets treatment experienced, on average, a significantly lower relapse rate than those receiving placebo. <BR>                        An examination of population subgroups from this trial did not reveal any clear evidence of a differential maintenance effect on the basis of age or gender.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     14.3 Pediatric OCD Study<BR>                     <BR>                        The effectiveness of fluvoxamine maleate tablets for the treatment of OCD was also demonstrated in a 10 week multicenter, parallel group study in a pediatric outpatient population (children and adolescents, ages 8 to 17). Patients in this study were titrated to a total daily fluvoxamine dose of approximately 100 mg/day over the first two weeks of the trial, following which the dose was adjusted within a range of 50 to 200 mg/day (on a b.i.d. schedule) on the basis of response and tolerance. All patients had moderate-to-severe OCD (DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) total score of 24. Patients receiving fluvoxamine maleate experienced mean reductions of approximately six units on the CY-BOCS total score, compared to a three-unit reduction for placebo patients.<BR>                        <BR>                           Table 7 provides the outcome classification by treatment group on the Global Improvement item of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale for the pediatric study.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" border="single" width="437" ID="id_4c917bb6-9f4a-4a22-a7e0-84c9802e1ae4"><BR>                           <caption ID="id_aa8358a9-9095-4202-82f7-31e67d5fe675">TABLE 7: OUTCOME CLASSIFICATION (%) ON CGI-GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT ITEM FOR COMPLETERS IN PEDIATRIC STUDY</caption><BR>                           <col width="33.0%"/><BR>                           <col width="34.0%"/><BR>                           <col width="33.1%"/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr ID="id_f55b2d8a-4828-41c4-a3db-a1e83c89a3f9"><BR>                                 <td align="justify" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Toprule Rrule Lrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Outcome Classification</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Fluvoxamine (N = 38)</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Placebo (N = 36)</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_886869e5-f617-4154-aef7-19253cd6a113"><BR>                                 <td align="justify" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule">Very Much Improved</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">21%</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">11%</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_80620151-9a9d-4ee5-a5fa-54eebb031265"><BR>                                 <td align="justify" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule">Much Improved</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">18%</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">17%</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_0cc655f8-a1f2-4a86-b7f2-fca6a70ff1e5"><BR>                                 <td align="justify" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule">Minimally Improved</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">37%</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">22%</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_3823043e-5364-432e-a523-c4c9a56ae3da"><BR>                                 <td align="justify" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule">No Change</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">16%</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">44%</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_fe24660d-37f8-42ae-88a7-62c94baf8e12"><BR>                                 <td align="justify" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule">Worse</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Rrule">8%</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">6%</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR> <BR>                        Post hoc exploratory analyses for gender effects on outcomes did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender.

While the significance of these results is not clear, the 2 to 3 fold higher steady state plasma fluvoxamine concentrations in children compared to adolescents [see Clinical Pharmacology, Pediatric Subjects (12.3)] is suggestive that decreased exposure in adolescents may have been a factor, and dose adjustment in adolescents (up to the adult maximum dose of 300 mg) may be indicated to achieve therapeutic benefit.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
