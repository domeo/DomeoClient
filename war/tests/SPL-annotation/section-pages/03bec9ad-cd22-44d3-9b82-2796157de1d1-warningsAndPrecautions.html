WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS<BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Reduced effectiveness in impaired CYP2C19 function: Avoid concomitant use with omeprazole or esomeprazole. (5.1) <BR>                           Bleeding: Clopidogrel bisulfate increases risk of bleeding.  Discontinue 5 days prior to elective surgery. (5.2) <BR>                           Discontinuation of clopidogrel bisulfate: Premature discontinuation increases risk of cardiovascular events. (5.3) <BR>                           Recent transient ischemic attack or stroke: Combination use of clopidogrel bisulfate and aspirin in these patients was not shown to be more effective than clopidogrel bisulfate alone, but was shown to increase major bleeding. (5.4) <BR>                           Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported with clopidogrel bisulfate, including fatal cases.

Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning] and by concomitant medications that interfere with CYP2C19.<BR>                        <BR>                           Proton Pump Inhibitors <BR>                        <BR>                        Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel bisulfate with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel bisulfate [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     5.2 General Risk of Bleeding<BR>                     <BR>                        Thienopyridines, including clopidogrel bisulfate, increase the risk of bleeding. If a patient is to undergo surgery and an antiplatelet effect is not desired, discontinue clopidogrel bisulfate five days prior to surgery. In patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to CABG the rates of major bleeding were similar (event rate 4.4% clopidogrel bisulfate + aspirin; 5.3% placebo + aspirin). In patients who remained on therapy within five days of CABG, the major bleeding rate was 9.6% for clopidogrel bisulfate + aspirin, and 6.3% for placebo + aspirin. <BR>                        Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7-10 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of clopidogrel’s active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     5.3 Discontinuation of Clopidogrel Bisulfate<BR>                     <BR>                        Avoid lapses in therapy, and if clopidogrel bisulfate must be temporarily discontinued, restart as soon as possible. Premature discontinuation of clopidogrel bisulfate may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     5.4 Patients with Recent Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke<BR>                     <BR>                        In patients with recent TIA or stroke who are at high risk for recurrent ischemic events, the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate has not been shown to be more effective than clopidogrel bisulfate alone, but the combination has been shown to increase major bleeding. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     5.5 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)<BR>                     <BR>                        TTP, sometimes fatal, has been reported following use of clopidogrel bisulfate, sometimes after a short exposure (<2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). It is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragmented RBCs] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
