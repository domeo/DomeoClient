Although Clostridium difficile has been shown in vitro to be sensitive to rifampin, pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with the use of rifampin (and other broad spectrum antibiotics). Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who develop diarrhea in association with antibiotic use. Rarely, hepatitis or a shock-like syndrome with hepatic involvement and abnormal liver function tests has been reported.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Hematologic<BR><BR>                  Thrombocytopenia has occurred primarily with high dose intermittent therapy, but has also been noted after resumption of interrupted treatment. It rarely occurs during well supervised daily therapy. This effect is reversible if the drug is discontinued as soon as purpura occurs. Cerebral hemorrhage and fatalities have been reported when rifampin administration has been continued or resumed after the appearance of purpura.<BR>Rare reports of disseminated intravascular coagulation have been observed.<BR>Leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, and decreased hemoglobin have been observed.<BR>Agranulocytosis has been reported very rarely.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Central Nervous System<BR><BR>                  Headache, fever, drowsiness, fatigue, ataxia, dizziness, inability to concentrate, mental confusion, behavioral changes, pains in extremities, and generalized numbness have been observed.<BR>Psychoses have been rarely reported.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Ocular<BR><BR>                  Visual disturbances have been observed.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Endocrine<BR><BR>                  Menstrual disturbances have been observed.<BR>Rare reports of adrenal insufficiency in patients with compromised adrenal function have been observed.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Renal<BR><BR>                  Elevations in BUN and serum uric acid have been reported. Rarely, hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, hematuria, interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, renal insufficiency, and acute renal failure have been noted. These are generally considered to be hypersensitivity reactions. They usually occur during intermittent therapy or when treatment is resumed following intentional or accidental interruption of a daily dosage regimen, and are reversible when rifampin is discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Dermatologic<BR><BR>                  Cutaneous reactions are mild and self-limiting and do not appear to be hypersensitivity reactions.<BR>Typically, they consist of flushing and itching with or without a rash. More serious cutaneous reactions which may be due to hypersensitivity occur but are uncommon.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Hypersensitivity Reactions<BR><BR>                  Occasionally, pruritis, urticaria, rash, pemphigoid reaction, erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis, eosinophilia, sore mouth, sore tongue, and conjunctivitis have been observed.<BR>Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Miscellaneous<BR><BR>                  Rare reports of myopathy and muscular weakness have also been observed.<BR>Edema of the face and extremities has been reported. Other reactions reported to have occurred with intermittent dosage regimens includeflu syndrome(such as episodes of fever, chills, headache, dizziness, and bone pain), shortness of breath, wheezing, decrease in blood pressure and shock. Theflu syndromemay also appear if rifampin is taken irregularly by the patient or if daily administration is resumed after a drug free interval.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
