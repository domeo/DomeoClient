The plasma elimination half-life of perphenazine was independent of dose and ranged between 9 and 12 hours. In a study in which normal volunteers (n=12) received perphenazine 4 mg q8h for 5 days, steady-state concentrations of perphenazine were reached within 72 hours. Mean (%CV) Cmax and Cmin values for perphenazine and 7-hydroxyperphenazine at steady-state are listed below:<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ID="id_36512db7-04b7-485e-82e9-f9a81553efa7" border="single" width="444.000"><BR>                           <col width="33.3%"/><BR>                           <col width="33.3%"/><BR>                           <col width="33.3%"/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr ID="id_32164727-7424-41d9-aef7-5c89a4c1ea8a"><BR>                                 <td align="center" styleCode="Botrule Toprule Rrule Lrule" valign="bottom"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Parameter</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" styleCode="Botrule Rrule" valign="bottom"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Perphenazine</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" styleCode="Botrule Rrule" valign="bottom"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">7-Hydroxyperphenazine</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_4e869d2a-69be-440f-a6bd-90a42e7716cd"><BR>                                 <td align="center" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule" valign="bottom">C<sub>max</sub> (pg/mL)</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" styleCode="Botrule Rrule" valign="bottom">984 (43)</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" styleCode="Botrule Rrule" valign="bottom">509 (25)</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_57b94cac-ddc5-4a9e-bbc3-69768e30d617"><BR>                                 <td align="center" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule" valign="bottom">C<sub>min</sub> (pg/mL)</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" styleCode="Rrule" valign="bottom">442 (76)</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" styleCode="Botrule Rrule" valign="bottom">350 (56)</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR>Peak 7-hydroxyperphenazine concentrations were observed between 2 to 4 hours with a terminal phase half-life ranging between 9.9 to 18.8 hours. Perphenazine is extensively metabolized in the liver to a number of metabolites by sulfoxidation, hydroxylation, dealkylation, and glucuronidation. The pharmacokinetics of perphenazine covary with the hydroxylation of debrisoquine which is mediated by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP 2D6) and thus is subject to genetic polymorphism – i.e., 7% to 10% of Caucasians and a low percentage of Asians have little or no activity and are called “poor metabolizers.” Poor metabolizers of CYP 2D6 will metabolize perphenazine more slowly and will experience higher concentrations compared with normal or “extensive” metabolizers.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
