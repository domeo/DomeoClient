Each item<BR>on the ADHDRS maps directly to one symptom criterion for<BR>ADHD in the DSM–IV.<BR>                        In Study 1,<BR>an 8–week randomized, double–blind, placebo–controlled,<BR>dose–response, acute treatment study of children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 (N=297), patients received either a fixed dose of STRATTERA (0.5,<BR>1.2, or 1.8 mg/kg/day) or placebo. STRATTERA was<BR>administered as a divided dose in the early morning and late afternoon/early<BR>evening. At the 2 higher doses, improvements in ADHD symptoms<BR>were statistically significantly superior in STRATTERA–treated<BR>patients compared with placebo–treated patients as measured on the ADHDRS<BR>scale. The 1.8 mg/kg/day STRATTERA dose<BR>did not provide any additional benefit over that observed with the 1.2 mg/kg/day<BR>dose. The 0.5 mg/kg/day STRATTERA dose<BR>was not superior to placebo.<BR>                        In Study 2,<BR>a 6–week randomized, double–blind, placebo–controlled, acute<BR>treatment study of children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 (N=171),<BR>patients received either STRATTERA or<BR>placebo. STRATTERA was<BR>administered as a single dose in the early morning and titrated on a weight–adjusted<BR>basis according to clinical response, up to a maximum dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day.<BR>The mean final dose of STRATTERA was<BR>approximately 1.3 mg/kg/day. ADHD symptoms were statistically<BR>significantly improved on STRATTERA compared<BR>with placebo, as measured on the ADHDRS scale. This study shows that STRATTERA is<BR>effective when administered once daily in the morning.<BR>                        In 2 identical,<BR>9–week, acute, randomized, double–blind, placebo–controlled<BR>studies of children aged 7 to 13<BR>(Study 3, N=147; Study 4, N=144), STRATTERA and<BR>methylphenidate were compared with placebo. STRATTERA was<BR>administered as a divided dose in the early morning and late afternoon (after<BR>school) and titrated on a weight–adjusted basis according to clinical<BR>response. The maximum recommended STRATTERA dose<BR>was 2.0 mg/kg/day. The mean final dose of STRATTERA for<BR>both studies was approximately 1.6 mg/kg/day. In both studies,<BR>ADHD symptoms statistically significantly improved more on STRATTERA than<BR>on placebo, as measured on the ADHDRS scale.<BR>                        Examination of population subsets<BR>based on gender and age (<12 and 12 to 17)<BR>did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings.<BR>There was not sufficient exposure of ethnic groups other than Caucasian to<BR>allow exploration of differences in these subgroups.<BR>                        <BR>                           Maintenance Study — The effectiveness of STRATTERA in the maintenance treatment of ADHD was established in an outpatient study of children and adolescents (ages 6-15 years). Patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for ADHD who showed continuous response for about 4 weeks during an initial 10 week open-label treatment phase with STRATTERA (1.2 to 1.8 mg/kg/day) were randomized to continuation of their current dose of STRATTERA (N=292) or to placebo (N=124) under double-blind treatment for observation of relapse. Response during the open-label phase was defined as CGI-ADHD-S score ≤2 and a reduction of at least 25% from baseline in ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv total score. Patients who were assigned to STRATTERA and showed continuous response for approximately 8 months during the first double-blind treatment phase were again randomized to continuation of their current dose of STRATTERA (N=81) or to placebo (N=82) under double-blind treatment for observation of relapse. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as CGI-ADHD-S score increases of at least 2 from the end of open-label phase and ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv total score returns to ≥90% of study entry score for 2 consecutive visits. In both double-blind phases, patients receiving continued STRATTERA treatment experienced significantly longer times to relapse than those receiving placebo.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     14.2  ADHD studies in Adults<BR>                     <BR>                        The effectiveness of STRATTERA in<BR>the treatment of ADHD was established in 2 randomized, double–blind,<BR>placebo–controlled clinical studies of adult patients, age 18<BR>and older, who met DSM–IV criteria for ADHD.<BR>                        Signs and symptoms of ADHD were<BR>evaluated using the investigator–administered Conners Adult ADHD Rating<BR>Scale Screening Version (CAARS), a 30–item scale. The<BR>primary effectiveness measure was the 18–item Total ADHD Symptom score<BR>(the sum of the inattentive and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales from the<BR>CAARS) evaluated by a comparison of mean change from baseline to endpoint<BR>using an intent–to–treat analysis.<BR>                        In 2 identical,<BR>10–week, randomized, double–blind, placebo–controlled acute<BR>treatment studies (Study 5, N=280; Study 6,<BR>N=256), patients received either STRATTERA or<BR>placebo. STRATTERA was<BR>administered as a divided dose in the early morning and late afternoon/early<BR>evening and titrated according to clinical response in a range of 60 to 120 mg/day.<BR>The mean final dose of STRATTERA for<BR>both studies was approximately 95 mg/day. In both studies,<BR>ADHD symptoms were statistically significantly improved on STRATTERA,<BR>as measured on the ADHD Symptom score from the CAARS scale.<BR>                        Examination of population subsets<BR>based on gender and age (<42 and ≥42)<BR>did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings.<BR>There was not sufficient exposure of ethnic groups other than Caucasian to<BR>allow exploration of differences in these subgroups.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
