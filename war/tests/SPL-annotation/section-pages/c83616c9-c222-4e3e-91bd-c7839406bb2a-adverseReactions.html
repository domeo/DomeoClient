Patients ranged in age <BR>from 18 to 90 years (median age 48 years), with 54% female, 85% Caucasian, 8% <BR>Black, 4% Asian, and 3% other races. Six randomized controlled clinical trials <BR>were conducted for the treatment of EE, maintenance of healed EE, and <BR>symptomatic GERD, which included 896 patients on placebo, 455 patients on <BR>KAPIDEX 30 mg, 2218 patients on KAPIDEX 60 mg, and 1363 patients on lansoprazole <BR>30 mg once daily. <BR>                  As clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse <BR>reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly <BR>compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the <BR>rates observed in practice.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Most Commonly Reported Adverse <BR>Reactions<BR>                  <BR>                  The most common adverse reactions
