Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patients. A low initial daily dosage with gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. The Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules may be opened and the beads sprinkled over food, such as a teaspoon of applesauce or other similar food products if this method of administration is preferred. Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules or their contents should not be crushed or chewed. Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules can be taken with or without meals.<BR>                  Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules are an extended-release formulation for twice a day administration. When converting patients from immediate release carbamazepine to Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules, the same total daily mg dose of carbamazepine should be administered.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
