AROMASIN should not be coadministered with estrogen-containing agents as <BR>these could interfere with its pharmacologic action.<BR>                  <BR>                  Hepatic InsufficiencyThe pharmacokinetics of exemestane have been investigated in <BR>subjects with moderate or severe hepatic insufficiency (Childs-Pugh B or C). <BR>Following a single 25-mg oral dose, the AUC of exemestane was approximately 3 <BR>times higher than that observed in healthy volunteers. The safety of chronic <BR>dosing in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment has not been <BR>studied. Based on experience with exemestane at repeated doses up to 200 mg <BR>daily that demonstrated a moderate increase in non-life threatening adverse <BR>events, dosage adjustment does not appear to be necessary.<BR>                  <BR>                  Renal InsufficiencyThe AUC of exemestane after a single 25-mg dose was approximately <BR>3 times higher in subjects with moderate or severe renal insufficiency <BR>(creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared <BR>with the AUC in healthy volunteers. The safety of chronic dosing in patients <BR>with moderate or severe renal impairment has not been studied. Based on <BR>experience with exemestane at repeated doses up to 200 mg daily that <BR>demonstrated a moderate increase in non-life threatening adverse events, dosage <BR>adjustment does not appear to be necessary.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  Laboratory TestsIn patients with early breast cancer the incidence of <BR>hematological abnormalities of Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade greater than or equal to 1 was lower <BR>in the exemestane treatment group, compared with tamoxifen. Incidence of CTC <BR>grade 3 or 4 abnormalities was low (approximately 0.1%) in both treatment <BR>groups. Approximately 20% of patients receiving exemestane in clinical studies <BR>in advanced breast cancer, experienced CTC grade 3 or 4 lymphocytopenia. Of <BR>these patients, 89% had a pre-existing lower grade lymphopenia. Forty percent of <BR>patients either recovered or improved to a lesser severity while on treatment. <BR>Patients did not have a significant increase in viral infections, and no <BR>opportunistic infections were observed. Elevations of serum levels of AST, ALT, <BR>alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase less than greater than 5 times the upper value <BR>of the normal range (i.e., greater than or equal to  CTC grade 3) have been rarely reported in patients <BR>treated for advanced breast cancer but appear mostly attributable to the <BR>underlying presence of liver and/or bone metastases. In the comparative study in <BR>advanced breast cancer patients, CTC grade 3 or 4 elevation of gamma glutamyl <BR>transferase without documented evidence of liver metastasis was reported in 2.7% <BR>of patients treated with AROMASIN and in 1.8% of patients treated with megestrol <BR>acetate.<BR>                  In patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline <BR>phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving exemestane than <BR>either tamoxifen or placebo. Treatment emergent bilirubin elevations (any CTC <BR>grade) occurred in 5.3% of exemestane patients and 0.8% of tamoxifen patients on <BR>the IES, and in 6.9% of exemestane treated patients vs. 0% of placebo treated <BR>patients on the 027 study. CTC grade 3–4 increases in bilirubin occurred in 0.9% <BR>of exemestane treated patients compared to 0.1% of tamoxifen treated patients. <BR>Alkaline phosphatase elevations of any CTC grade occurred in 15.0% of exemestane <BR>treated patients on the IES compared to 2.6% of tamoxifen treated patients, and <BR>in 13.7% of exemestane treated patients compared to 6.9% of placebo treated <BR>patients on study 027. Creatinine elevations occurred in 5.8% of exemestane <BR>treated patients and 4.3% of tamoxifen treated patients on the IES and in 5.5% <BR>of exemestane treated patients and 0% of placebo treated patients on study <BR>027.<BR>                  Reductions in bone mineral density (BMD) over time are seen with exemestane <BR>use. Table 7 describes changes in BMD from baseline to 24 months in patients <BR>receiving exemestane compared to patients receiving tamoxifen (IES) or placebo <BR>(027).

Significant pharmacokinetic <BR>interactions mediated by inhibition of CYP isoenzymes therefore appear unlikely. <BR>Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, <BR>phenobarbital, or St. John's wort) may significantly decrease exposure to <BR>exemestane. Dose modification is recommended for patients who are also receiving <BR>a potent CYP 3A4 inducer (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and <BR>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).<BR>                  <BR>                  Drug/Laboratory Tests InteractionsNo clinically relevant changes in the results of clinical <BR>laboratory tests have been observed.<BR>                  <BR>                  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of <BR>FertilityA 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice at doses of 50, 150 and <BR>450 mg/kg/day exemestane (gavage), resulted in an increased incidence of <BR>hepatocellular adenomas and/or carcinomas in both genders at the high dose <BR>level. Plasma AUCs(0–24hr) at the high dose were 2575 ± <BR>386 and 5667 ± 1833 ng.hr/mL in males and females (approx. 34 and 75 fold the <BR>AUC in postmenopausal patients at the recommended clinical dose). An increased <BR>incidence of renal tubular adenomas was observed in male mice at the high dose <BR>of 450 mg/kg/day. Since the doses tested in mice did not achieve an MTD, <BR>neoplastic findings in organs other than liver and kidneys remain unknown. <BR>                  A separate carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at the doses of 30, <BR>100 and 315 mg/kg/day exemestane (gavage) for 92 weeks in males and 2 years in <BR>females. No evidence of carcinogenic activity up to the highest dose tested of <BR>315 mg/kg/day was observed in females. The male rat study was inconclusive since <BR>it was terminated prematurely at Week 92. At the highest dose, plasma AUC(0–24hr) levels in male (1418 ± 287 ng.hr/mL) and female (2318 <BR>± 1067 ng.hr/mL) rats were 19 and 31 fold higher than those measured in <BR>postmenopausal cancer patients, receiving the recommended clinical dose.<BR>                  Exemestane was not mutagenic in vitro in bacteria (Ames test) or mammalian <BR>cells (V79 Chinese hamster lung cells). Exemestane was clastogenic in human <BR>lymphocytes in vitro without metabolic activation but was not clastogenic in <BR>vivo (micronucleus assay in mouse bone marrow). Exemestane did not increase <BR>unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes when tested in vitro.<BR>                  In a pilot reproductive study in rats, male rats were treated with doses of <BR>125–1000 mg/kg/day exemestane, beginning 63 days prior to and during <BR>cohabitation. Untreated female rats showed reduced fertility when mated to males <BR>treated with greater than or equal to 500 mg/kg/day exemestane (greater than or equal to 200 times the recommended human dose on <BR>a mg/m2 basis). In a separate study, exemestane was given <BR>to female rats at 4–100 mg/kg/day beginning 14 days prior to mating and through <BR>day 15 or 20 of gestation. Exemestane increased the placental weights at greater than or equal to 4 <BR>mg/kg/day greater than or equal to 1.5 times the human dose on a mg/m2 basis). <BR>Exemestane showed no effects on ovarian function, mating behavior, and <BR>conception rate in rats given doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 times <BR>the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis), however, <BR>decreases in mean litter size and fetal body weight, along with delayed <BR>ossification were evidenced at greater than or equal to 20 mg/kg/day. In general toxicology studies, <BR>changes in the ovary, including hyperplasia, an increase in the incidence of <BR>ovarian cysts and a decrease in corpora lutea were observed with variable <BR>frequency in mice, rats and dogs at doses that ranged from 3–20 times the human <BR>dose on a mg/m2 basis. <BR>                  <BR>                  Pregnancy<BR>                  Pregnancy Category DSee WARNINGS.<BR>                  <BR>                  Nursing MothersAROMASIN is only indicated in postmenopausal women. However, <BR>radioactivity related to exemestane appeared in rat milk within 15 minutes of <BR>oral administration of radiolabeled exemestane. Concentrations of exemestane and <BR>its metabolites were approximately equivalent in the milk and plasma of rats for <BR>24 hours after a single oral dose of 1 mg/kg 14C-exemestane. It is not known whether exemestane is excreted <BR>in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be <BR>exercised if a nursing woman is inadvertently exposed to AROMASIN (see WARNINGS).<BR>                  <BR>                  Pediatric UseThe safety and effectiveness of AROMASIN in pediatric patients <BR>have not been evaluated.<BR>                  <BR>                  Geriatric UseThe use of AROMASIN in geriatric patients does not require <BR>special precautions.<BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
