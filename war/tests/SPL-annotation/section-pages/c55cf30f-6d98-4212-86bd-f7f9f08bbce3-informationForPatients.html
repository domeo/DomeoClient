A patient Medication Guide aboutAntidepressant Medicines, Depression and Other Serious Mental Illnesses, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actionsis available for paroxetine. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking paroxetine.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk<BR><BR>                  <BR>Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.<BR><BR>                  Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)<BR><BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of paroxetine and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Interference With Cognitive and Motor Performance<BR><BR>                  <BR>Any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Although in controlled studies paroxetine has not been shown to impair psychomotor performance, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with paroxetine does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Completing Course of Therapy<BR><BR>                  <BR>While patients may notice improvement with treatment with paroxetine in 1 to 4 weeks, they should be advised to continue therapy as directed.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Concomitant Medication<BR><BR>                  <BR>Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Alcohol<BR><BR>                  <BR>Although paroxetine has not been shown to increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking paroxetine.<BR><BR>                  <BR>Pregnancy<BR><BR>                  <BR>Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy (seeWARNINGS: Usage in Pregnancy: Teratogenic EffectsandNonteratogenic Effects).<BR><BR>                  <BR>Nursing<BR><BR>                  <BR>Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding an infant (seePRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers).<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
