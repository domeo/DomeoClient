There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of a human response, clopidogrel bisulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        Studies in rats have shown that clopidogrel and/or its metabolites are excreted in the milk. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from clopidogrel, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4 Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established. <BR>                        Additional information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated in neonates and infants is approved in the package insert for Bristol-Myers Squibb’s clopidogrel tablets.

In COMMIT, approximately 58% of the patients treated with clopidogrel bisulfate were 60 years and older, 26% of whom were 70 years and older. <BR>                        The observed risk of bleeding events with clopidogrel bisulfate plus aspirin versus placebo plus aspirin by age category is provided in Table 1 and Table 2 for the CURE and COMMIT trials, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
