Approximately one-third of the patients met DSM-IV criteria for inattentive subtype and two-thirds met criteria for both inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive subtypes. <BR>                        Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated by a comparison of mean change from baseline to endpoint for atomoxetine hydrochloride and placebo-treated patients using an intent-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome measure, the investigator administered and scored  ADHD Rating Scale-IV-Parent Version (ADHDRS) total score including hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. Each item on the ADHDRS maps directly to one symptom criterion for ADHD in the DSM-IV. <BR>                        In Study 1, an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response, acute treatment study of children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 (N=297), patients received either a fixed dose of atomoxetine hydrochloride (0.5, 1.2, or 1.8 mg/kg/day) or placebo. Atomoxetine hydrochloride was administered as a divided dose in the early morning and late afternoon/early evening. At the 2 higher doses, improvements in ADHD symptoms were statistically significantly superior in atomoxetine hydrochloride-treated patients compared with  placebo-treated patients as measured on the ADHDRS scale. The 1.8 mg/kg/day atomoxetine hydrochloride dose did not provide any additional  benefit over that observed with the 1.2 mg/kg/day dose. The 0.5 mg/kg/day atomoxetine hydrochloride dose was not superior to placebo. <BR>                        In Study 2, a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, acute treatment study of children and adolescents  aged 6 to 16 (N=171), patients received either atomoxetine hydrochloride or placebo. Atomoxetine hydrochloride was administered as a single dose in the early  morning and titrated on a weight-adjusted basis according to clinical response, up to a maximum dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day. The mean  final dose of atomoxetine hydrochloride was approximately 1.3 mg/kg/day. ADHD symptoms were statistically significantly improved on  atomoxetine hydrochloride compared with placebo, as measured on the ADHDRS scale. This study shows that atomoxetine hydrochloride is effective when  administered once daily in the morning.<BR>                        In 2 identical, 9-week, acute, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of children aged 7 to 13 (Study 3, N=147; Study 4, N=144), atomoxetine hydrochloride and methylphenidate were compared with placebo. Atomoxetine hydrochloride was administered as a divided dose in the early morning and late afternoon (after school) and titrated on a weight-adjusted basis according to clinical response. The  maximum recommended atomoxetine hydrochloride dose was 2 mg/kg/day. The mean final dose of atomoxetine hydrochloride for both studies was  approximately 1.6 mg/kg/day. In both studies, ADHD symptoms statistically significantly improved more on atomoxetine hydrochloride than on placebo, as measured on the ADHDRS scale. <BR>                        Examination of population subsets based on gender and age (<12 and 12 to 17) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings. There was not sufficient exposure of ethnic groups other than Caucasian to allow exploration of differences in these subgroups. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     14.2   ADHD studies in Adults <BR>                     <BR>                        The effectiveness of atomoxetine hydrochloride in the treatment of ADHD was established in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of adult patients, age 18 and older, who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. <BR>                        Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated using the investigator-administered Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale Screening Version (CAARS), a 30-item scale. The primary effectiveness measure was the 18-item Total ADHD Symptom score (the sum of the inattentive and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales from the CAARS) evaluated by a comparison of mean change from baseline to endpoint using an intent-to-treat analysis. <BR>                        In 2 identical, 10-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled acute treatment studies (Study 5, N=280; Study 6, N=256), patients received either atomoxetine hydrochloride or placebo. Atomoxetine hydrochloride was administered as a divided dose in the early morning and late afternoon/early evening and titrated according to clinical response in a range of 60 to 120 mg/day. The mean final dose of atomoxetine hydrochloride for both studies was approximately 95 mg/day. In both studies, ADHD symptoms were statistically significantly improved on atomoxetine hydrochloride, as measured on the ADHD Symptom score from the CAARS scale. <BR>                        Examination of population subsets based on gender and age (<42 and ≥42) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings. There was not sufficient exposure of ethnic groups other than Caucasian to allow exploration of differences in these subgroups. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
