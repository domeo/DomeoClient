The highest dose caused increased early intrauterine deaths, decreased fetal weight and length, decreased fetal skeletal ossification, and an increased incidence of minor fetal skeletal anomalies and variations; this dose also caused decreased maternal food consumption and weight gain.<BR>                        In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rabbits were given 4, 10, or 25 mg/kg/day (3, 8, and 20 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) of iloperidone during the period of organogenesis.  The highest dose caused increased early intrauterine deaths and decreased fetal viability at term; this dose also caused maternal toxicity.<BR>                        In additional studies in which rats were given iloperidone at doses similar to the above beginning from either pre-conception or from day 17 of gestation and continuing through weaning, adverse reproductive effects included prolonged pregnancy and parturition, increased stillbirth rates, increased incidence of fetal visceral variations, decreased fetal and pup weights, and decreased post-partum pup survival. There were no drug effects on the neurobehavioral or reproductive development of the surviving pups. No-effect doses ranged from 4 to 12 mg/kg except for the increase in stillbirth rates which occurred at the lowest dose tested of 4 mg/kg, which is 1.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Maternal toxicity was seen at the higher doses in these studies.<BR>                        The iloperidone metabolite P95, which is a major circulating metabolite of iloperidone in humans but is not present in significant amounts in rats, was given to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 20, 80, or 200 mg/kg/day. No teratogenic effects were seen. Delayed skeletal ossification occurred at all doses. No significant maternal toxicity was produced. Plasma levels of P95 (AUC) at the highest dose tested were 2 times those in humans receiving the MRHD of iloperidone.<BR>                        There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.<BR>                        Non-Teratogenic Effects<BR>                        Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates.  These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. <BR>                        FANAPT should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.2	Labor and Delivery<BR>                     <BR>                        The effect of FANAPT on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3	Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        FANAPT was excreted in milk of rats during lactation.  It is not known whether FANAPT or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  It is recommended that women receiving FANAPT should not breast feed.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4	Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Safety and effectiveness in pediatric and adolescent patients have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5	Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Clinical Studies of FANAPT in the treatment of schizophrenia did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether or not they respond differently than younger adult patients.  Of the 3210 patients treated with FANAPT in pre-marketing trials, 25 (0.5%) were ≥65 years old and there were no patients ≥75 years old.<BR>                        Studies of elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer’s disease have suggested that there may be a different tolerability profile (i.e., increased risk in mortality and cerebrovascular events including stroke) in this population compared to younger patients with schizophrenia [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].  The safety and efficacy of FANAPT in the treatment of patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer’s disease has not been established.  If the prescriber elects to treat such patients with FANAPT, vigilance should be exercised.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.6	Renal Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        Because FANAPT is highly metabolized, with less than 1% of the drug excreted unchanged, renal impairment alone is unlikely to have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of FANAPT.  Renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) had minimal effect on maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of iloperidone (given in a single dose of 3 mg) and its metabolites P88 and P95 any of the three analytes measured.  AUC0–∞ was increased by 24%, decreased by 6%, and increased by 52% for iloperidone, P88 and P95, respectively, in subjects with renal impairment.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.7	Hepatic Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        A study in mild and moderate liver impairment has not been conducted.
