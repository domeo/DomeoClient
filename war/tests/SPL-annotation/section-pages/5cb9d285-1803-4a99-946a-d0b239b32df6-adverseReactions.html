In a Phase 1 trial, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 14.8 g/m2/d for four days.  The daily recommended dose of BUSULFEX contains DMA equivalent to 42% of the MTD on a mg/m2 basis.  The dose-limiting toxicities in the Phase 1 study were hepatotoxicity as evidenced by increased liver transaminase (SGOT) levels and neurological symptoms as evidenced by hallucinations.  The hallucinations had a pattern of onset at one day post completion of DMA administration and were associated with EEG changes.  The lowest dose at which hallucinations were recognized was equivalent to 1.9 times that delivered in a conditioning regimen utilizing BUSULFEX 0.8 mg/kg every 6 hours ×16 doses.  Other neurological toxicities included somnolence, lethargy, and confusion.  The relative contribution of DMA and/or other concomitant medications to neurologic and hepatic toxicities observed with BUSULFEX is difficult to ascertain.<BR>                  Treatment with BUSULFEX at the recommended dose and schedule will result in profound myelosuppression in 100% of patients, including granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, or a combined loss of formed elements of the blood.<BR>                  Adverse reaction information is primarily derived from the clinical study (N=61) of BUSULFEX and the data obtained for high-dose oral busulfan conditioning in the setting of randomized, controlled trials identified through a literature review.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     BUSULFEX Clinical Trials<BR>                     <BR>                        In the BUSULFEX (busulfan) Injection allogeneic stem cell transplantation clinical trial, all patients were treated with BUSULFEX 0.8 mg/kg as a two‑hour infusion every six hours for 16 doses over four days, combined with cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg ×2 days.  Ninety-three percent (93%) of evaluable patients receiving this dose of BUSULFEX maintained an AUC less than 1,500 µM∙min for dose 9, which has generally been considered the level that minimizes the risk of HVOD.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="85%"><BR>                           <caption>Table 3:

Following hematopoietic progenitor cell infusion, recovery of neutrophil counts to ≥500 cells/mm3 occurred at median day 13 when prophylactic G-CSF was administered to the majority of participants on the study.  The median number of platelet transfusions per patient on study was 6, and the median number of red blood cell transfusions on study was 4.  Prolonged prothrombin time was reported in one patient (2%).<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Gastrointestinal<BR>                           <BR>                              Gastrointestinal toxicities were frequent and generally considered to be related to the drug.  Few were categorized as serious.  Mild or moderate nausea occurred in 92% of patients in the allogeneic clinical trial, and mild or moderate vomiting occurred in 95% through BMT Day +28; nausea was severe in 7%.  The incidence of vomiting during BUSULFEX administration (BMT Day –7 to –4) was 43% in the allogeneic clinical trial.  Grade 3-4 stomatitis developed in 26% of the participants, and Grade  3 esophagitis developed in 2%.  Grade 3-4 diarrhea was reported in 5% of the allogeneic study participants, while mild or moderate diarrhea occurred in 75%.  Mild or moderate constipation occurred in 38% of patients; ileus developed in 8% and was severe in 2%.  Forty-four percent (44%) of patients reported mild or moderate dyspepsia.  Two percent (2%) of patients experienced mild hematemesis.  Pancreatitis developed in 2% of patients.  Mild or moderate rectal discomfort occurred in 24% of patients.

Grade 3/4 hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 30% of patients within 28 days of transplantation and was considered life-threatening in 5% of these patients. Hyperbilirubinemia was associated with graft-versus-host disease in six patients and with hepatic veno-occlusive disease in 5 patients.  Grade 3/4 SGPT elevations occurred in 7% of patients.  Alkaline phosphatase increases were mild or moderate in 15% of patients.  Mild or moderate jaundice developed in 12% of patients, and mild or moderate hepatomegaly developed in 6%.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Hepatic veno-occlusive disease<BR>                           <BR>                              Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD) is a recognized potential complication of conditioning therapy prior to transplant.  Based on clinical examination and laboratory findings, hepatic veno-occlusive disease was diagnosed in 8% (5/61) of patients treated with BUSULFEX in the setting of allogeneic transplantation, was fatal in 2/5 cases (40%), and yielded an overall mortality from HVOD in the entire study population of 2/61 (3%).

One patient (2%) experienced severe hyperventilation; and in 2 (3%) additional patients it was mild or moderate.  Mild rhinitis and mild or moderate cough were reported in 44% and 28% of patients, respectively.  Mild epistaxis events were reported in 25%.  Three patients (5%) on the allogeneic study developed documented alveolar hemorrhage.  All required mechanical ventilatory support and all died.  Non-specific interstitial fibrosis was found on wedge biopsies performed with video assisted thoracoscopy in one patient on the allogeneic study who subsequently died from respiratory failure on BMT Day +98.

One patient (1%) developed a life-threatening cerebral hemorrhage and a coma as a terminal event following multi-organ failure after HVOD.  Other events considered severe included delirium (2%), agitation (2%), and encephalopathy (2%).  The overall incidence of confusion was 11%, and 5% of patients were reported to have experienced hallucinations.  The patient who developed delirium and hallucination on the allogeneic study had onset of confusion at the completion of BUSULFEX (busulfan) Injection.  The overall incidence of lethargy in the allogeneic BUSULFEX clinical trial was 7%, and somnolence was reported in 2%.
