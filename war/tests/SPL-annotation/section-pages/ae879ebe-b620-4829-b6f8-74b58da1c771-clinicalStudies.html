Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio within two separate cohorts (Cohort 1/non-Black and Cohort 2/Black) and were stratified by HCV genotype (1a or 1b) and by HCV-RNA viral load (less than or equal to 400,000 IU per mL vs. more than 400,000 IU per mL) to one of the following three treatment arms:<BR>                        <BR>                           PegIntron + REBETOL for 48 weeks (PR48).<BR>                           PegIntron + REBETOL for four weeks followed by VICTRELIS 800 mg three times daily + PegIntron + REBETOL for 24 weeks. The subjects were then continued on different regimens based on Treatment Week (TW) 8 through TW24 response-guided therapy (boceprevir-RGT). All subjects in this treatment arm were limited to 24 weeks of therapy with VICTRELIS. 						<BR>                                 Subjects with undetectable HCV-RNA (Target Not Detected) at TW8 (early responders) and remained undetectable through TW24 discontinued therapy and entered follow-up at the TW28 visit.<BR>                                 Subjects with detectable HCV-RNA at TW8 or any subsequent treatment week but subsequently achieving undetectable HCV-RNA (Target Not Detected) at TW24 (late responders) were changed in a blinded fashion to placebo at the TW28 visit and continued therapy with PegIntron + REBETOL for an additional 20 weeks, for a total treatment duration of 48 weeks.<BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           PegIntron + REBETOL for four weeks followed by VICTRELIS 800 mg three times daily + PegIntron + REBETOL for 44 weeks (boceprevir-PR48).<BR>                        <BR>                        All subjects with detectable HCV-RNA in plasma at TW24 were discontinued from treatment. Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) was defined as plasma HCV-RNA less than 25 IU/mL at Follow-up Week 24. Plasma HCV-RNA results at Follow-up Week 12 were used if plasma HCV-RNA results at Follow-up Week 24 were missing.<BR>                        Mean age of subjects randomized was 49 years. The racial distribution of subjects was as follows: 82% White, 14% Black, and 4% others. The distribution of subjects by gender was 60% men and 40% women.<BR>                        The addition of VICTRELIS to PegIntron and REBETOL significantly increased the SVR rates compared to PegIntron and REBETOL alone in the combined cohort (63% to 66% in arms containing VICTRELIS vs. 38% PR48 control) for randomized subjects who received at least one dose of any study medication (Full-Analysis-Set population). SVR rates for Blacks who received the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron and REBETOL were 42% to 53% in a predefined analysis (see Table 10).<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="100%" ID="t10"><BR>                           <caption>Table 10 Sustained Virologic Response (SVR)<footnote ID="t10fn1">The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all randomized subjects (N=1097) who received at least one dose of any study medication (PegIntron, REBETOL, or VICTRELIS).</footnote><BR>                              <sup>, </sup><BR>                              <footnote ID="F1">Sustained Virologic Response (SVR): reported as plasma HCV-RNA &lt;25 IU/mL at follow-up week (FW) 24.

The study enrolled subjects with serum hemoglobin concentrations of less than 15 g per dL. Subjects were treated for 4 weeks with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin followed by up to 44 weeks of VICTRELIS plus peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. If a subject became anemic (serum hemoglobin of approximately less than or equal to 10 g per dL within the treatment period), the subject was randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ribavirin dose reduction (N=249) or use of erythropoietin 40,000 units subcutaneously once weekly for the management of the anemia (N=251). If serum hemoglobin concentrations continued to decrease to  less than or equal to 8.5 g per dL, subjects could be treated with additional anemia interventions, including the addition of erythropoietin (18% of those in the ribavirin dose reduction arm) or ribavirin dose reduction (37% of those in the ESA arm).<BR>                        Mean age of subjects randomized was 49 years.

The SVR rate in subjects randomized who received ribavirin dose reduction was 71% (178/249), similar to the SVR rate of 71% (178/251) in subjects randomized to receive an ESA.
