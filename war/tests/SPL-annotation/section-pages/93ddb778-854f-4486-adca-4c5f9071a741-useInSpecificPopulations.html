There have been post-market reports of spontaneous abortions and infant congenital anomalies from women who have taken Gleevec. Imatinib mesylate was teratogenic in rats when administered during organogenesis at doses ≥100 mg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum human dose of 800 mg/day based on body surface area). Teratogenic effects included exencephaly or encephalocele, absent/reduced frontal and absent parietal bones. Female rats administered doses ≥45 mg/kg (approximately one-half the maximum human dose of 800 mg/day based on body surface area) also experienced significant post-implantation loss as evidenced by either early fetal resorption or stillbirths, nonviable pups and early pup mortality between postpartum Days 0 and 4. At doses higher than 100 mg/kg, total fetal loss was noted in all animals. Fetal loss was not seen at doses ≤30 mg/kg (one-third the maximum human dose of 800 mg).<BR>                        There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Gleevec in pregnant women. Women should be advised not to become pregnant when taking Gleevec. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Imatinib and its active metabolite are excreted into human milk. Based on data from three breastfeeding women taking Gleevec, the milk:plasma ratio is about 0.5 for imatinib and about 0.9 for the active metabolite. Considering the combined concentration of imatinib and active metabolite, a breastfed infant could receive up to 10 % of the maternal therapeutic dose based on body weight. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Gleevec, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        8.4 Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Gleevec safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in children with newly diagnosed Ph+ chronic phase CML. There are no data in children under 2 years of age. <BR>                        As in adult patients, imatinib was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in pediatric patients, with a Cmax of 2-4 hours. Apparent oral clearance was similar to adult values (11.0 L/hr/m2 in children vs. 10.0 L/hr/m2 in adults), as was the half-life (14.8 hours in children vs. 17.1 hours in adults). Dosing in children at both 260 mg/m2 and 340 mg/m2 achieved an AUC similar to the 400 mg dose in adults. The comparison of AUC on Day 8 vs. Day 1 at 260 mg/m2 and 340 mg/m2 dose levels revealed a 1.5- and 2.2-fold drug accumulation, respectively, after repeated once-daily dosing. Mean imatinib AUC did not increase proportionally with increasing dose.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        8.5 Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        In the CML clinical studies, approximately 20% of patients were older than 65 years. In the study of patients with newly diagnosed CML, 6% of patients were older than 65 years. No difference was observed in the safety profile in patients older than 65 years as compared to younger patients, with the exception of a higher frequency of edema <BR>                           [<BR>                           see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                           ].

Exposure to both imatinib and CGP74588 was comparable between each of the mildly and moderately hepatically-impaired groups and the normal group. Patients with severe hepatic impairment tend to have higher exposure to both imatinib and its metabolite than patients with normal hepatic function. At steady state, the mean Cmax/dose and AUC/dose for imatinib increased by about 63% and 45%, respectively, in patients with severe hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. The mean Cmax/dose and AUC/dose for CGP74588 increased by about 56% and 55%, respectively, in patients with severe hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function <BR>                           [<BR>                           see Dosage and Administration (2.<BR>                           11<BR>                           )<BR>                           ].<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ID="i436b769f-d601-43cd-881b-0c3a8c861421"><BR>                           <caption>Table 13 Liver Function Classification</caption><BR>                           <col width="158"/><BR>                           <col width="130"/><BR>                           <col width="181"/><BR>                           <col width="136"/><BR>                           <col width="129"/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Liver Function Test</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Normal</content><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold"><BR>                                       <br/>(n=14)</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Mild</content><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold"><BR>                                       <br/>(n=30)</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Moderate</content><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold"><BR>                                       <br/>(n=20)</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Severe</content><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold"><BR>                                       <br/>(n=20)</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule " align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Total Bilirubin</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule " align="center">&#8804;ULN</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule " align="center">&gt;1.0-1.5x ULN</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule " align="center">&gt;1.5-3x ULN</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule " align="center">&gt;3-10x ULN</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">SGOT</content><BR>                                    <br/><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center">&#8804;ULN</td><BR>                                 <td align="center">&gt;ULN (can be normal if Total Bilirubin is &gt;ULN)</td><BR>                                 <td align="center">Any</td><BR>                                 <td align="center">Any</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule " colspan="5">ULN=upper limit of normal for the institution</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                     <BR><BR><BR><BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        8.7 <BR>                        Renal Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of imatinib was assessed in 59 cancer patients with varying degrees of renal impairment (Table 14) at single and steady state imatinib doses ranging from 100 to 800 mg/day. The mean exposure to imatinib (dose normalized AUC) in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment increased 1.5- to 2-fold compared to patients with normal renal function. The AUCs did not increase for doses greater than 600 mg in patients with mild renal impairment. The AUCs did not increase for doses greater than 400 mg in patients with moderate renal impairment. Two patients with severe renal impairment were dosed with 100 mg/day and their exposures were similar to those seen in patients with normal renal function receiving 400 mg/day. Dose reductions are necessary for patients with moderate and severe renal impairment [<BR>                           See <BR>                           Dosage and Administration<BR>                            (2.<BR>                           10<BR>                           )<BR>                           ].<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ID="ide57a88a-b00d-45cd-8f49-433b9b2898ce"><BR>                           <caption>Table 14 Renal Function Classification</caption><BR>                           <col width="355"/><BR>                           <col width="379"/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule "><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Renal Dysfunction</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule "><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Renal Function Tests</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule "><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Mild</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule ">CrCL = 40-59 mL/min</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Moderate</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td>CrCL = 20-39 mL/min</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Severe </content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td>CrCL = &lt;20 mL/min</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule " colspan="2">CrCL = Creatinine Clearance</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                     <BR><BR><BR><BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
