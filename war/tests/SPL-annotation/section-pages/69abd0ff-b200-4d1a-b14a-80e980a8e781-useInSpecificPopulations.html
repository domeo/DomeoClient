EXEMESTANE is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of EXEMESTANE in pregnant women.<BR>                               In non-clinical studies in rats and rabbits, EXEMESTANE was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and abortifacient. Radioactivity related to 14C-EXEMESTANE crossed the placenta of rats following oral administration of 1 mg/kg EXEMESTANE. The concentration of EXEMESTANE and its metabolites was approximately equivalent in maternal and fetal blood. When rats were administered EXEMESTANE from 14 days prior to mating until either days 15 or 20 of gestation, and resuming for the 21 days of lactation, an increase in placental weight was seen at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5 times the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2 basis). Prolonged gestation and abnormal or difficult labor was observed at doses equal to or greater than 20 mg/kg/day. Increased resorption, reduced number of live fetuses, decreased fetal weight, and retarded ossification were also observed at these doses. No malformations were noted when EXEMESTANE was administered to pregnant rats during the organogenesis period at doses up to 810 mg/kg/day (approximately 320 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis). Daily doses of EXEMESTANE, given to rabbits during organogenesis, caused a decrease in placental weight at 90 mg/kg/day (approximately 70 times the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2 basis). Abortions, an increase in resorptions, and a reduction in fetal body weight were seen at 270 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of malformations in rabbits at doses up to 270 mg/kg/day (approximately 210 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis).<BR>                              If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and the potential risk for pregnancy loss.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        EXEMESTANE is only indicated in postmenopausal women. However, radioactivity related to EXEMESTANE appeared in rat milk within 15 minutes of oral administration of radiolabeled EXEMESTANE. Concentrations of EXEMESTANE and its metabolites were approximately equivalent in the milk and plasma of rats for 24 hours after a single oral dose of 1 mg/kg 14C-EXEMESTANE. It is not known whether EXEMESTANE is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reaction in nursing infants from EXEMESTANE, a decision should be made whether to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4 Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5 Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        The use of EXEMESTANE in geriatric patients does not require special precautions.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.6 Hepatic Insufficiency<BR>                     <BR>                        The pharmacokinetics of EXEMESTANE have been investigated in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic insufficiency (Childs-Pugh B or C). Following a single 25-mg oral dose, the AUC of EXEMESTANE was approximately 3 times higher than that observed in healthy volunteers.<BR>                        The safety of chronic dosing in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. Based on experience with EXEMESTANE at repeated doses up to 200 mg daily that demonstrated a moderate increase in non life-threatening adverse events, dosage adjustment does not appear to be necessary.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.7 Renal Insufficiency<BR>                     <BR>                        The AUC of EXEMESTANE after a single 25-mg dose was approximately 3 times higher in subjects with moderate or severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <35 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared with the AUC in healthy volunteers.
