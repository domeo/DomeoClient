The prescribed dose should be administered orally, with a meal and a large glass of water. Doses of 400 mg or 600 mg should be administered once daily, whereas a dose of 800 mg should be administered as 400 mg twice a day.<BR>                  In children, Gleevec treatment can be given as a once-daily dose in CML and Ph+ ALL. Alternatively, in children with CML the daily dose may be split into two - one portion dosed in the morning and one portion in the evening. There is no experience with Gleevec treatment in children under 1 year of age.<BR>                  For patients unable to swallow the film-coated tablets, the tablets may be dispersed in a glass of water or apple juice. The required number of tablets should be placed in the appropriate volume of beverage (approximately 50 mL for a 100 mg tablet, and 200 mL for a 400 mg tablet) and stirred with a spoon. The suspension should be administered immediately after complete disintegration of the tablet(s).<BR>                  For daily dosing of 800 mg and above, dosing should be accomplished using the 400 mg tablet to reduce exposure to iron.<BR>                  Treatment may be continued as long as there is no evidence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Adults with Ph+ CML CP (2.1):<BR>		     <BR>	400 mg/day<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Adults with Ph+ CML AP or BC (2.1):<BR>		     <BR>	600 mg/day<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Pediatrics with Ph+ CML CP (2.2):<BR>		     <BR>	340 mg/m2/day <BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Adults with Ph+ ALL (2.3):<BR>		     <BR>	600 mg/day<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Pediatrics with Ph+ ALL (2.4):<BR>		     <BR>	340 mg/m2/day<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Adults with MDS/MPD (2.5):<BR>		     <BR>	400 mg/day<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Adults with ASM (2.6):<BR>		     <BR>	100 mg/day or 400 mg/day<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Adults with HES/CEL (2.7):<BR>		     <BR>	100 mg/day or 400 mg/day<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Adults with DFSP (2.8):<BR>		     <BR>	800 mg/day<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Adults with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST (2.9):<BR>		     <BR>	400 mg/day<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Adjuvant treatment of adults with GIST (2.10):<BR>		     <BR>	 400 mg/day<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (2.11):<BR>		     <BR>	400 mg/day<BR><BR>                           <BR>                           Patients with severe hepatic impairment (2.11):<BR>		     <BR>	300 mg/day<BR>                        <BR>                        All doses of Gleevec should be taken with a meal and a large glass of water.

In adults, treatment with Gleevec may then be continued at a reduced daily dose (i.e., 400 mg to 300 mg, 600 mg to 400 mg or 800 mg to 600 mg).
