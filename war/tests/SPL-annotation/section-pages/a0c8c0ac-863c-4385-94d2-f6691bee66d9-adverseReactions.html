The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. <BR>                        Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient. The most common (>2%) adverse reactions are tiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, shortness of breath, bradycardia, and rash. <BR>                        <BR>                           Heart Failure: In the MERIT-HF study comparing metoprolol succinate extended-release in daily doses up to 200 mg (mean dose 159 mg once-daily; n=1990) to placebo (n=2001), 10.3% of metoprolol succinate extended-release patients discontinued for adverse reactions vs. 12.2% of placebo patients. <BR>                        The table below lists adverse reactions in the MERIT-HF study that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 1% in the metoprolol succinate extended-release group and greater than placebo by more than 0.5%, regardless of the assessment of causality. <BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ID="id_d634959e-c700-4f70-b96c-d80ecd454857"><BR>                           <caption ID="id_303d3454-41e9-4c41-816e-d541bd6e167f">Adverse Reactions Occurring in the MERIT-HF Study at an Incidence &#8805; 1% in the Metoprolol Succinate Extended-release Group and Greater Than Placebo by More Than 0.5%</caption><BR>                           <col width="276px"/><BR>                           <col width="222px"/><BR>                           <col width="201px"/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr ID="id_7dc81252-bd91-4052-bfa4-3ff734b52f90"><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Toprule Rrule">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="bottom" styleCode="Rrule">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Metoprolol Succinate<br/>Extended-release<br/>n=1990 % of patients</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="bottom">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Placebo<br/>n=2001 % of patients</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_68e89d02-b04e-4062-bb5a-eed65eca1b0c"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Rrule">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dizziness/vertigo </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Rrule">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;1.8</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;1.0</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_99cdcb78-a49f-4517-87cb-b7c77273aedb"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Rrule">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bradycardia </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Rrule">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;1.5</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;0.4</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_472230f1-38d9-420d-86c1-297ff74807ae"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Accident and/or injury </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Rrule">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;1.4</td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;0.8</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR><BR>                           Post-operative Adverse Events: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8351 patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic disease undergoing non-vascular surgery and who were not taking beta–blocker therapy, metoprolol succinate extended-release 100 mg was started 2 to 4 hours prior to surgery then continued for 30 days at 200 mg per day.
