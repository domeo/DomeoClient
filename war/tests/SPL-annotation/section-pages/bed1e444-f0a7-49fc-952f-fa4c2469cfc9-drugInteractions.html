However, there is no effect on the extent of absorption. The lower peak concentrations appear due to a slower rate of absorption, with the time required to achieve peak concentrations on average 20â€“25 minutes greater in the presence of antacids. However, this difference was not statistically significant.<BR>                        <BR>                           Compounds Which Inhibit Certain Hepatic Enzymes<BR>                        <BR>                        There is a potentially relevant interaction between diazepam and compounds which inhibit certain hepatic enzymes (particularly cytochrome P450 3A and 2C19). Data indicate that these compounds influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam and may lead to increased and prolonged sedation. At present, this reaction is known to occur with cimetidine, ketoconazole, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, and omeprazole.<BR>                        <BR>                           Phenytoin<BR>                        <BR>                        There have also been reports that the metabolic elimination of phenytoin is decreased by diazepam.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               </P></DIV></HTML>
