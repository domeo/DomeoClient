Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of atorvastatin calcium tablets should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation and/or upon titration of atorvastatin calcium tablets, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.   <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.2  Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years of age)  <BR>                     <BR>                        The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population).

In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing atorvastatin and the lowest dose necessary employed.  In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with atorvastatin should be limited to  20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin is employed. In patients with HIV taking nelfinavir, therapy with atorvastatin should be limited to 40 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin is employed [see <BR>                              Warnings and <BR>            Precautions<BR>                              , <BR>                              Skeletal Muscle (5.1)<BR>                           , <BR>                              Drug Interactions (7)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
