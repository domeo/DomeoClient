The molecular formula is C27H45N5O5 and its molecular weight is 519.7. Boceprevir has the following structural formula:<BR>                  <BR>                  Boceprevir is manufactured as an approximately equal mixture of two diastereomers. Boceprevir is a white to off-white amorphous powder. It is freely soluble in methanol, ethanol and isopropanol and slightly soluble in water.<BR>                  VICTRELIS 200 mg capsules are available as hard gelatin capsules for oral administration. Each capsule contains 200 mg of boceprevir and the following inactive ingredients: sodium lauryl sulfate, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, pre-gelatinized starch, and magnesium stearate. The red capsule cap consists of gelatin, titanium dioxide, D&C Yellow #10, FD&C Blue #1, and FD&C Red #40. The yellow capsule body contains gelatin, titanium dioxide, D&C Yellow #10, FD&C Red #40, and FD&C Yellow #6. The capsule is printed with red and yellow ink. The red ink contains shellac and red iron oxide, while the yellow ink consists of shellac, titanium dioxide, povidone and D&C Yellow #10 Aluminum Lake.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     image of boceprevir chemical structure<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
