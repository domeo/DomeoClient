Patients were required to have either ECG changes compatible with new ischemia (without ST-elevation) or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or T to at least twice the upper limit of normal. The patient population was largely Caucasian (82%) and included 38% women, and 52% patients ≥65 years of age.  <BR>                        Patients were randomized to receive clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily) or placebo, and were treated for up to one year. Patients also received aspirin (75-325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies such as heparin. The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors was not permitted for three days prior to randomization.  <BR>                        The number of patients experiencing the primary outcome (CV death, MI, or stroke) was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the placebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10%-28%; p < 0.001) for the clopidogrel-treated group (see Table 4).  <BR>                        <BR>                         Table 4: Outcome Events in the CURE Primary Analysis <BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" border="0" width="0.000" ID="id_38571bd5-d780-4d86-9a95-b3bc4c12f5a1"><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr ID="id_8cc50412-374b-4db4-882d-4289d3a0985b" styleCode="Toprule"><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Outcome </content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="left" valign="top" colspan="2" styleCode="Toprule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The benefits associated with clopidogrel were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of clopidogrel was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75-325 mg once daily).

The overall relative risk reduction (9.8% vs. 10.6%) was 8.7%, p=0.045. Similar results were obtained when all-cause mortality and all-cause strokes were counted instead of vascular mortality and ischemic strokes (risk reduction 6.9%). In patients who survived an  on-study stroke or myocardial infarction, the incidence of subsequent events was lower in the clopidogrel group.  <BR>                        The curves showing the overall event rate are shown in Figure 8.

However, because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke, the effect of clopidogrel is substantial.  <BR>                        The CAPRIE trial included a population that was randomized on the basis of 3 entry criteria. The efficacy of clopidogrel relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these randomized subgroups (p=0.043). It is not clear whether this difference is real or a chance occurrence. Although the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups, the benefit appeared to be strongest in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral vascular disease (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) and weaker in stroke patients. In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction, clopidogrel was not numerically superior to aspirin.   <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        14.3 Lack of Established Benefit of Clopidogrel plus Aspirin in Patients with Multiple Risk Factors or Established Vascular Disease <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              CHARISMA <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                        The CHARISMA trial was a 15,603 subject, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study comparing clopidogrel (75 mg daily) to placebo for prevention of ischemic events in patients with vascular disease or multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis.
