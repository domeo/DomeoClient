The risk of dependence increases with duration of treatment; it is also greater in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse.<BR>                        Patients should be advised against the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other CNS-depressant drugs during diazepam therapy. As is true of most CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving diazepam should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               </P></DIV></HTML>
