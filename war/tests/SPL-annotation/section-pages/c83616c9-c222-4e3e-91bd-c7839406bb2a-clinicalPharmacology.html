Dexlansoprazole is <BR>eliminated with a half-life of approximately 1 to 2 hours in healthy subjects <BR>and in patients with symptomatic GERD.

The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) after <BR>multiple doses in symptomatic GERD patients was 40.3 L.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Metabolism<BR>                  <BR>                  Dexlansoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by oxidation, <BR>reduction, and subsequent formation of sulfate, glucuronide and glutathione <BR>conjugates to inactive metabolites. Oxidative metabolites are formed by the <BR>cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system including hydroxylation mainly by CYP2C19, <BR>and oxidation to the sulfone by CYP3A4. <BR>                  CYP2C19 is a polymorphic liver enzyme which exhibits three phenotypes in the <BR>metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates; extensive metabolizers (*1/*1), intermediate <BR>metabolizers (*1/mutant) and poor metabolizers (mutant/mutant). Dexlansoprazole <BR>is the major circulating component in plasma regardless of CYP2C19 metabolizer <BR>status. In CYP2C19 intermediate and extensive metabolizers, the major plasma <BR>metabolites are 5-hydroxy dexlansoprazole and its glucuronide conjugate, while <BR>in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers dexlansoprazole sulfone is the major plasma <BR>metabolite.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Elimination<BR>                  <BR>                  Following the administration of KAPIDEX, no unchanged dexlansoprazole is <BR>excreted in urine. Following the administration of [14C]dexlansoprazole to 6 healthy male subjects, approximately <BR>50.7% (standard deviation (SD): 9.0%) of the administered radioactivity was <BR>excreted in urine and 47.6% (SD: 7.3%) in the feces. Apparent clearance (CL/F) <BR>in healthy subjects was 11.4 to 11.6 L/h, respectively, after 5-days of 30 or 60 <BR>mg once daily administration.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Effect of CYP2C19 Polymorphism on Systemic <BR>Exposure of Dexlansoprazole<BR>                  <BR>                  Systemic exposure of dexlansoprazole is generally higher in intermediate and <BR>poor metabolizers. In male Japanese subjects who received a single dose of <BR>KAPIDEX 30 mg or 60 mg (N=2 to 6 subjects/group), mean dexlansoprazole Cmax and AUC values were up to 2 times higher in intermediate <BR>compared to extensive metabolizers; in poor metabolizers, mean Cmax was up to 4 times higher and mean AUC was up to 12 times <BR>higher compared to extensive metabolizers. Though such study was not conducted <BR>in Caucasians and African Americans, it is expected dexlansoprazole exposure in <BR>these races will be affected by CYP2C19 phenotypes as well.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  12.4 Effect of Food on Pharmacokinetics and <BR>PharmacodynamicsIn food-effect studies in healthy subjects receiving KAPIDEX <BR>under various fed conditions compared to fasting, increases in Cmax ranged from 12% to 55%, increases in AUC ranged from 9% to <BR>37%, and tmax varied (ranging from a decrease of 0.7 <BR>hours to an increase of 3 hours). No significant differences in mean <BR>intragastric pH were observed between fasted and various fed conditions. <BR>However, the percentage of time intragastric pH exceeded 4 over the 24-hour <BR>dosing interval decreased slightly when KAPIDEX was administered after a meal <BR>(57%) relative to fasting (64%), primarily due to a decreased response in <BR>intragastric pH during the first 4 hours after dosing. Because of this, while <BR>KAPIDEX can be taken without regard to food, some patients may benefit from <BR>administering the dose prior to a meal if post-meal symptoms do not resolve <BR>under post-fed conditions.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  12.5 Special Populations<BR>                  <BR>                     Pediatric Use<BR>                  <BR>                  The pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole in patients under the age of 18 years <BR>have not been studied. <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Geriatric Use<BR>                  <BR>                  The terminal elimination half-life of dexlansoprazole is significantly <BR>increased in geriatric subjects compared to younger subjects (2.23 and 1.5 <BR>hours, respectively); this difference is not clinically relevant. <BR>Dexlansoprazole exhibited higher systemic exposure (AUC) in geriatric subjects <BR>(34.5% higher) than younger subjects. No dosage adjustment is needed in <BR>geriatric patients [see Use in Specific <BR>Populations (8.5)]. <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Renal Impairment<BR>                  <BR>                  Dexlansoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver to inactive <BR>metabolites, and no parent drug is recovered in the urine following an oral dose <BR>of dexlansoprazole. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole are not <BR>expected to be altered in patients with renal impairment, and no studies were <BR>conducted in subjects with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. In addition, the <BR>pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole were studied in patients with mild, moderate or <BR>severe renal impairment; results demonstrated no need for a dose adjustment for <BR>this patient population.<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Hepatic Impairment<BR>                  <BR>                  In a study of 12 patients with moderately impaired hepatic function who <BR>received a single oral dose of KAPIDEX 60 mg, plasma exposure (AUC) of bound and <BR>unbound dexlansoprazole in the hepatic impairment group was approximately 2 <BR>times greater compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. This difference <BR>in exposure was not due to a difference in protein binding between the two liver <BR>function groups. No adjustment for KAPIDEX is necessary for patients with mild <BR>hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). KAPIDEX 30 mg should be considered for <BR>patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). No studies have <BR>been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) <BR>[see Use in Specific Populations <BR>(8.7)].<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Gender<BR>                  <BR>                  In a study of 12 male and 12 female healthy subjects who received a single <BR>oral dose of KAPIDEX 60 mg, females had higher systemic exposure (AUC) (42.8% <BR>higher) than males.

However, there have been <BR>reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs and <BR>warfarin concomitantly [see Drug <BR>Interactions (7.2)].<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Cytochrome P 450 Interactions <BR>                  <BR>                  Dexlansoprazole is metabolized, in part, by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. <BR><BR>                  In vitro studies have shown that KAPIDEX is not likely to inhibit CYP <BR>isoforms 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 or 3A4. As such, no <BR>clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes <BR>would be expected. Furthermore, clinical drug-drug interaction studies in mainly <BR>CYP2C19 extensive and intermediate metabolizers have shown that KAPIDEX does not <BR>affect the pharmacokinetics of diazepam, phenytoin, or theophylline. The <BR>subjects' CYP1A2 genotypes in the drug-drug interaction study with theophylline <BR>were not determined.<BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     image of Figure 1: Mean Plasma graph<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
