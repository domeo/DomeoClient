The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers<BR>to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents.<BR>Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication<BR>Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have.<BR>                        Patients should be advised of the following issues<BR>and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking STRATTERA.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.2  Suicide Risk<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients, their families, and their caregivers<BR>should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic<BR>attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia<BR>(psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior,<BR>depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during STRATTERA treatment<BR>and when the dose is adjusted. Families and caregivers of patients should<BR>be advised to observe for the emergence of such symptoms on a day–to–day<BR>basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the<BR>patient’s prescriber or health professional, especially if they are<BR>severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting<BR>symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk<BR>for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring<BR>and possibly changes in the medication.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.3  Severe Liver Injury<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients initiating STRATTERA should<BR>be cautioned that severe liver injury may develop.
