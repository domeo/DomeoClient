Propranolol hydrochloride tablets are not indicated for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies.<BR>                        Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade can cause reduction of intraocular pressure. Patients should be told that propranolol hydrochloride tablets may interfere with the glaucoma screening test. Withdrawal may lead to a return of increased intraocular pressure.<BR>                        While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Clinical Laboratory Tests<BR>                     <BR>                        In patients with hypertension, use of propranolol has been associated with elevated levels of serum potassium, serum transaminases, and alkaline phosphatase. In severe heart failure, the use of propranolol has been associated with increases in Blood Urea Nitrogen.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Drug Interactions<BR>                     <BR>                        Caution should be exercised when propranolol hydrochloride tablets are administered with drugs that have an effect on CYP2D6, 1A2, or 2C19 metabolic pathways. Co-administration of such drugs with propranolol may lead to clinically relevant drug interactions and changes on its efficacy and/or toxicity (see <BR>                              Drug Interactions in PHARMACOKINETICS AND DRUG METABOLISM).<BR>                        <BR>                        Cardiovascular Drugs<BR>                        <BR>                           Antiarrhythmics<BR>                        <BR>                        Propafenone has negative inotropic and beta-blocking properties that can be additive to those of propranolol. <BR>                        Quinidine increases the concentration of propranolol and produces greater degrees of clinical beta-blockade and may cause postural hypotension.<BR>                        Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with Î²-blockers such as propranolol.<BR>                        The clearance of lidocaine is reduced with administration of propranolol. Lidocaine toxicity has been reported following coadministration with propranolol.<BR>                        Caution should be exercised when administering propranolol hydrochloride tablets with drugs that slow A-V nodal conduction, e.g. digitalis, lidocaine and calcium channel blockers.<BR>                        <BR>                           Digitalis Glycosides<BR>                        <BR>                        Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate.

On a body surface area basis, this dose in the mouse and rat is, respectively, about equal to and about twice the maximum recommended human oral daily dose (MRHD) of 640 mg propranolol hydrochloride. In a study in which both male and female rats were exposed to propranolol hydrochloride in their diets at concentrations of up to 0.05% (about 50 mg/kg body weight and less than the MRHD), from 60 days prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation for two generations, there were no effects on fertility. Based on differing results from Ames Tests performed by different laboratories, there is equivocal evidence for a genotoxic effect of propranolol hydrochloride in bacteria (S. typhimurium strain TA 1538).<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Pregnancy:- Pregnancy Category C<BR>                     <BR>                        In a series of reproductive and developmental toxicology studies, propranolol hydrochloride was given to rats by gavage or in the diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. At doses of 150 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 80 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the MRHD on a body surface area basis), treatment was associated with embryotoxicity (reduced litter size and increased resorption rates) as well as neonatal toxicity (deaths). Propranolol hydrochloride also was administered (in the feed) to rabbits (throughout pregnancy and lactation) at doses as high as 150 mg/kg/day (about 5 times the maximum recommended human oral daily dose). No evidence of embryo or neonatal toxicity was noted.<BR>                        There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Intrauterine growth retardation, small placentas, and congenital abnormalities have been reported in neonates whose mothers received propranolol during pregnancy. Neonates whose mothers received propranolol at parturition have exhibited bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression. Adequate facilities for monitoring such infants at birth should be available. Propranolol hydrochloride tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        Propranolol is excreted in human milk.

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
