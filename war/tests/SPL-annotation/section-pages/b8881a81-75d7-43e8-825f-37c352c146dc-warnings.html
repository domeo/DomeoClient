Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain <BR>other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest <BR>predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that <BR>antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the <BR>emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of <BR>treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of <BR>antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the <BR>risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents <BR>and young adults (aged 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other <BR>psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk <BR>of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; <BR>there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 <BR>and older.<BR>                  The pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents <BR>with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders <BR>including a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 <BR>patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or <BR>other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median <BR>duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There <BR>was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency <BR>toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There <BR>were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different <BR>indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs <BR>placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across <BR>indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of <BR>cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.<BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ID="iebc08172-9555-4f7d-84bb-cf30f1fd88d1" width="866"><BR>                     <caption>Table 1</caption><BR>                     <tbody><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td>Age Range<br/><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td>Drug-Placebo Difference in <br/>&#160;Number of Cases of Suicidality per <BR><br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 1000 Patients Treated&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <br/><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td> Increases Compared to Placebo&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td>less than 18</td><BR>                           <td>14 additional cases</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td>18 to 24<br/><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td>5 additional cases</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <br/><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td>Decreases Compared to Placebo</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td>25 to 64<br/><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td>1 fewer case<br/><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td>&gt;65</td><BR>                           <td> 6 fewer cases<br/><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                     </tbody><BR>                  </table><BR>                  <BR><BR><BR><BR>                     <BR><BR>                  <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR>                     <BR><BR>                  <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in <BR>the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion <BR>about drug effect on suicide.<BR>                  It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., <BR>beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from <BR>placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of <BR>antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.<BR>                  <BR>                     All patients being treated with antidepressants for any <BR>indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical <BR>worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the <BR>initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, <BR>either increases or decreases.<BR>                  <BR>                  The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, <BR>irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor <BR>restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric <BR>patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as <BR>well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a <BR>causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of <BR>depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, <BR>there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging <BR>suicidality.<BR>                  Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including <BR>possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is <BR>persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms <BR>that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if <BR>these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's <BR>presenting symptoms.<BR>                  If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be <BR>tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt <BR>discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see           ADVERSE REACTIONS - Withdrawal Symptoms for a description <BR>of the risks of discontinuation of protriptyline hydrochloride tablets).<BR>                  <BR>                     Families and caregivers of patients being treated with <BR>antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both <BR>psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor <BR>patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in <BR>behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of <BR>suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. <BR>Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. <BR>Prescriptions for protriptyline hydrochloride tablets should be written <BR>for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in <BR>order to reduce the risk of overdose. <BR>                  <BR>                     Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major <BR>depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is <BR>generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating <BR>such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of <BR>precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. <BR>Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is <BR>unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients <BR>with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are <BR>at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed <BR>psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, <BR>and depression. It should be noted that protriptyline hydrochloride is not <BR>approved for use in treating bipolar depression.<BR>                  Protriptyline may block the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine or <BR>similarly acting compounds.<BR>                  Protriptyline should be used with caution in patients with a history of <BR>seizures, and, because of its autonomic activity, in patients with a tendency to <BR>urinary retention, or increased intraocular tension.<BR>                  Tachycardia and postural hypotension may occur more frequently with <BR>protriptyline than with other antidepressant drugs. Protriptyline should be used <BR>with caution in elderly patients and patients with cardiovascular disorders; <BR>such patients should be observed closely because of the tendency of the drug to <BR>produce tachycardia, hypotension, arrhythmias, and prolongation of the <BR>conduction time. Myocardial infarction and stroke have occurred with drugs of <BR>this class.<BR>                  On rare occasions, hyperthyroid patients or those receiving thyroid <BR>medication may develop arrhythmias when this drug is given.<BR>                  In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it should be borne in mind that <BR>the potentiation may increase the danger inherent in any suicide attempt or <BR>overdosage.<BR>                  <BR>                     Usage in Pregnancy: Safe use in pregnancy and <BR>lactation has not been established; therefore, use in pregnant women, nursing <BR>mothers or women who may become pregnant requires that possible benefits be <BR>weighed against possible hazards to mother and child.<BR>                  In mice, rats, and rabbits, doses about ten times greater than the <BR>recommended human doses had no apparent adverse effects on reproduction.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
