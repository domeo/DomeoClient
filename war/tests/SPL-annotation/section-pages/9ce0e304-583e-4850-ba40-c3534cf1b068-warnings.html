Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. <BR>                        Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.<BR>                        The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in TABLE<BR>                           1.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" border="1" width="444.000" ID="id_e90f2344-f3c0-4568-a116-add41b0298df"><BR>                           <caption ID="id_4c28bd3d-e256-416f-904e-ae6e0aad5a81">TABLE 1</caption><BR>                           <col width="50.0%"/><BR>                           <col width="50.0%"/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr ID="id_2173008d-12cd-48d4-b987-b7b7f43268c9"><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Toprule Rrule Lrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Age Range</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_6c51a7db-bb92-435d-a2b9-978d5ce8b36d"><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule"/><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">Increases Compared to Placebo</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_cf4af5e9-171f-4ec4-82f6-1f8121e69c34"><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule"> &lt; 18 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"> 14 additional cases </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_b5718afb-259c-428d-ad4b-b57b011ed2f1"><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule"> 18 to 24 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"> 5 additional cases </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_8a4ce089-e935-4df8-b001-acdf50f10cdf"><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule"/><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule">Decreases Compared to Placebo</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_88439a6d-70e9-43d0-bcf4-5d52682c34ed"><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule"> 25 to 64 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"> 1 fewer case </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr ID="id_38a76c10-63f1-4802-b211-99e2d8abba52"><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Lrule Botrule Rrule"> &#8805; 65 </td><BR>                                 <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode="Botrule Rrule"> 6 fewer cases </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.<BR>                        It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.<BR>                        <BR>                           All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.<BR>                        <BR>                        The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. <BR>                        Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.<BR>                        If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Discontinuation of Treatment With<BR>                           C<BR>                           italopram Tablets USP, for a description of the risks of discontinuation of citalopram tablets).<BR>                        <BR>                           Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers.<BR>                           Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for citalopram tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder<BR>                           <BR>                              A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that citalopram tablets are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Potential for Interaction With Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           In patients receiving serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma. These reactions have also been reported in patients who have recently discontinued SSRI treatment and have been started on an MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Furthermore, limited animal data on the effects of combined use of SSRIs and MAOIs suggest that these drugs may act synergistically to elevate blood pressure and evoke behavioral excitation. Therefore, it is recommended that citalopram should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping citalopram before starting an MAOI.<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-Like Reactions<BR>                           <BR>                              The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including citalopram treatment, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms. <BR>                              The concomitant use of citalopram with MAOIs intended to treat depression is contraindicated. If concomitant treatment of citalopram with a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist (triptan) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.<BR>                              The concomitant use of citalopram with serotonin precursors (such as tryptophan) is not recommended. Treatment with citalopram and any concomitant serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
