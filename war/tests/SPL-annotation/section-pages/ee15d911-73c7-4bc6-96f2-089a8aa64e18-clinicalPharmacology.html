It appears to act by reducing polysynaptic responses and blocking the post-tetanic potentiation. Carbamazepine  greatly reduces or abolishes pain induced by stimulation of the   infraorbital nerve in cats and rats. It depresses thalamic  potential and bulbar and polysynaptic reflexes, including the  linguomandibular reflex in cats. Carbamazepine is chemically  unrelated to other anticonvulsants or other drugs used to control the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. The mechanism of action remains unknown.<BR>                        The principal metabolite of carbamazepine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, has anticonvulsant activity as demonstrated in several in vivo animal models of seizures. Though clinical activity for the epoxide has been postulated, the significance  of its activity with respect to the safety and efficacy of carbamazepine has not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Carbamazepine (CBZ): Taken every 12 hours, Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules   provide steady state plasma levels comparable to  immediate-release carbamazepine tablets given every 6 hours, when administered at the same total mg daily dose. <BR>                        Following a single 200 mg oral extended-release dose of carbamazepine, peak plasma concentration was 1.9 ± 0.3 µg/mL and the time to reach the peak was 19 ±  7 hours. Following chronic administration (800 mg every 12  hours), the peak levels were 11.0 ± 2.5 µg/mL  and the time to reach the peak was 5.9 ± 1.8 hours. The pharmacokinetics of extended-release carbamazepine is linear over the single dose range of 200 to 800 mg. <BR>                        Carbamazepine is 76% bound to plasma proteins.  Carbamazepine is primarily metabolized in the liver. Cytochrome  P450 3A4 was identified as the major isoform responsible for the  formation of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide. Since carbamazepine  induces its own metabolism, the half-life is also variable. Following a single extended-release dose of carbamazepine, the average half-life range from 35 to 40 hours and 12 to 17 hours on repeated dosing. The apparent oral clearance following a single  dose was 25 ± 5 mL/min and following multiple dosing was 80 ± 30 mL/min.<BR>                        After oral administration of 14C-carbamazepine, 72% of the administered  radioactivity was found in the urine and 28% in the feces. This urinary radioactivity was composed largely of hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites, with only 3% of unchanged carbamazepine.<BR>                        <BR>                           Carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E): Carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide is considered to be an active metabolite of carbamazepine. Following a single  200 mg oral extended-release dose of carbamazepine, the peak plasma concentration of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide was 0.11 ± 0.012 µg/mL and the time to reach the peak was 36 ± 6 hours. Following chronic administration of a extended-release dose of carbamazepine (800 mg every 12 hours), the peak levels of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide were 2.2 ± 0.9 µg/mL and the time to reach the peak was 14 ± 8 hours. The plasma half-life of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide following administration of carbamazepine is 34 ± 9 hours. Following a single oral dose of extended-release carbamazepine (200 to 800 mg) the AUC and Cmax of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide were less than 10% of carbamazepine. Following multiple dosing of extended-release carbamazepine (800 to 1600 mg daily for 14 days), the AUC and Cmax of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide were dose related, ranging from 15.7 µg.hr/mL and 1.5 µg/mL at 800 mg/day to 32.6 µg.hr/mL and 3.2 µg/mL at 1600 mg/day, respectively, and were less than 30% of carbamazepine. Carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide is 50% bound to plasma proteins.<BR>                        <BR>                           Food Effect:The multiple dose study conducted in the fed state showed that the steady-state Cmax values were within the therapeutic concentration range. The pharmacokinetic profile of extended-release carbamazepine was similar when given by sprinkling the beads over applesauce compared to the intact capsule administered in the fasted state.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Special Populations<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Hepatic Dysfunction: The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine is not known. However, given that carbamazepine is primarily metabolized in the liver, it is prudent to proceed with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction.<BR>                        <BR>                           Renal Dysfunction:The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of  carbamazepine is not known.<BR>                        <BR>                           Gender: No difference in the mean AUC and Cmax of carbamazepine and<BR>carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide was found between males and females.<BR>                        <BR>                           Age: Carbamazepine is more rapidly metabolized to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide in young children than adults. In children below the age of 15, there is an inverse relationship between CBZ-E/CBZ ratio and increasing age.<BR>                        <BR>                           Race: No information is available on the effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
