This target dosage range is achieved by daily dosage adjustments, alerting patients to symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, starting at a dose of 1 mg twice daily, then moving to 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, and 12 mg twice daily on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively, to reach the 12 mg/day to 24 mg/day dose range.  FANAPT can be administered without regard to meals.

The recommended starting dose for FANAPT tablets is 1 mg twice daily.  Increases to reach the target dose range of 6-12 mg twice daily may be made with daily dosage adjustments to 2 mg twice daily, 4 mg twice daily, 6 mg twice daily, 8 mg twice daily, 10 mg twice daily, and 12 mg twice daily on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively.  Efficacy was demonstrated with FANAPT in a dose range of 6 to 12 mg twice daily.   Prescribers should be mindful of the fact that patients need to be titrated to an effective dose of FANAPT. Thus, control of symptoms may be delayed during the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment compared to some other antipsychotic drugs that do not require similar titration.  Prescribers should also be aware that some adverse effects associated with FANAPT use are dose related.<BR>                        The maximum recommended dose is 12 mg twice daily (24 mg/day); FANAPT doses above 24 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in the clinical trials.<BR>                        FANAPT can be administered without regard to meals.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.2	Dosage in Special Populations<BR>                     <BR>                        Dosage adjustments are not routinely indicated on the basis of age, gender, race, or renal impairment status [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Dosage adjustment for patients taking FANAPT concomitantly with potential CYP2D6 inhibitors:<BR>                           <BR>FANAPT dose should be reduced by one-half when administered concomitantly with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine or paroxetine.

Although immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with schizophrenia, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others.  In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
