The patient's dose should be carefully adjusted to a point where the suppression of tics and the relief afforded is balanced against the untoward side effects of the drug.<BR>                        An ECG should be done at baseline and periodically thereafter, especially during the period of dose adjustment (see <BR>                              WARNINGS<BR>                            and <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS - Laboratory Tests<BR>                           ). Periodic attempts should be made to reduce the dosage of ORAP to see whether or not tics persist at the level and extent first identified. In attempts to reduce the dosage of ORAP, consideration should be given to the possibility that increases of tic intensity and frequency may represent a transient, withdrawal-related phenomenon rather than a return of disease symptoms. Specifically, one to two weeks should be allowed to elapse before one concludes that an increase in tic manifestations is a function of the underlying disease syndrome rather than a response to drug withdrawal. A gradual withdrawal is recommended in any case.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Children<BR>                     <BR>                        Reliable dose response data for the effects of ORAP (pimozide) on tic manifestation in Tourette's Disorder patients below the age of twelve are not available.<BR>                        Treatment should be initiated at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg preferably taken once at bedtime. The dose may be increased every third day to a maximum of 0.2 mg/kg not to exceed 10 mg/day.<BR>                        At doses above 0.05 mg/kg/day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed. In poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers, ORAP doses should not exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day, and doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days (see <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS – Pharmacogenomics<BR>                           ).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Adults<BR>                     <BR>                        In general, treatment with ORAP should be initiated with a dose of 1 to 2 mg a day in divided doses. The dose may be increased thereafter every other day. Most patients are maintained at less than 0.2 mg/kg/day, or 10 mg/day, whichever is less. Doses greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day are not recommended.<BR>                        At doses above 4 mg/day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed. In poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers, ORAP doses should not exceed 4 mg/day, and doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days (see <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS – Pharmacogenomics<BR>                           ).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
