Both studies were similar in terms of disease characteristics and concomitant AED treatments. The most common concomitant AED treatments at baseline included: valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate.<BR>                  <BR>                     Study 1<BR>                  <BR>                  Study 1 (N=238) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisting of a 4-week baseline period followed by a 3-week titration period and 12-week maintenance period. Patients age 2-54 years with a current or prior diagnosis of LGS were stratified into 2 weight groups (12.5 kg to ≤30 kg or >30 kg) and then randomized to placebo or one of three target maintenance doses of ONFI according to Table 5.<BR>                  <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="80%"><BR>                     <caption><BR>Table 5.
