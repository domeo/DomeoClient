Partial responses were identified by the IRC in 19 patients randomized to Vectibix, for an overall response of 8% (95% CI: 5.0%, 12.6%).  No patient in the control arm had an objective response identified by the IRC.  The median duration of response was 17 weeks (95% CI: 16 weeks, 25 weeks).  There was no difference in overall survival between the study arms.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Figure 1<BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     14.2 Vectibix in Combination with Bevacizumab and Chemotherapy<BR>                     <BR>                        Vectibix shortened PFS, decreased survival time, and increased toxicity when given in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy in Study 2, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in the first-line treatment of mCRC.  Patients (n = 1053) were randomized 1:1 to Vectibix at a dose of 6 mg/kg given once every 2 weeks, in combination with bevacizumab and an oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based 5-fluorouracil-containing chemotherapy regimen, or to bevacizumab and chemotherapy alone.  Randomization was stratified by type of regimen (oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based); 86% of patients received an oxaliplatin-based regimen and 14% received an irinotecan-based regimen.<BR>                        The major study objective was comparison of PFS in the oxaliplatin stratum as determined by an independent central review. An interim analysis based on 257 PFS events in the oxaliplatin stratum demonstrated shorter PFS in patients receiving Vectibix, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy compared to those receiving bevacizumab and chemotherapy alone (median PFS was 8.8 months and 10.5 months; hazard ratio 1.44 [95% CI: 1.12, 1.85], p-value = 0.0024, Cox model with randomization factors as covariates).  An unplanned analysis of overall survival after 155 deaths (both strata combined), conducted at the time of the interim analysis of PFS, yielded an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.55 [95% CI: 1.12, 2.14], comparing patients receiving Vectibix, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy (92 deaths) to those receiving bevacizumab and chemotherapy alone (63 deaths) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     14.3 Lack of Efficacy of Anti-EGFR Monoclonal Antibodies in Patients with mCRC Containing KRAS Mutations<BR>                     <BR>                        Retrospective analyses as presented in Table 2 across seven randomized clinical trials suggest that anti-EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies are not effective for the treatment of patients with mCRC containing KRAS mutations.  In these trials, patients received standard of care (i.e., BSC or chemotherapy) and were randomized to receive either an anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab or panitumumab) or no additional therapy.  In all studies, investigational tests were used to detect KRAS mutations in codon 12 or 13.  The percentage of study populations for which KRAS status was assessed ranged from 23% to 92% [see Indications and Usage (1.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]<BR>                           .<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><BR>                           <caption>Table 2.
