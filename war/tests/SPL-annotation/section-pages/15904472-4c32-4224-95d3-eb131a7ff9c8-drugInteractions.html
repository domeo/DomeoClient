Enhanced marrow suppression has been noted in some patients also receiving trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.<BR>                        Inhibition of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, when given with mercaptopurine, has been reported.<BR>                        As there is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (e.g., olsalazine, mesalazine, or sulphasalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme, they should be administered with caution to patients receiving concurrent mercaptopurine therapy (see WARNINGS).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               </P></DIV></HTML>
