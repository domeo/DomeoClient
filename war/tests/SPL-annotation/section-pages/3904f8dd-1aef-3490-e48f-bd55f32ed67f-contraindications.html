In a clinical trial that studied ADCETRIS with bleomycin as part of a combination regimen, the rate of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity was higher than the historical incidence reported with ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Patients typically reported cough and dyspnea. Interstitial infiltration and/or inflammation were observed on radiographs and computed tomographic imaging of the chest. Most patients responded to corticosteroids.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        Concomitant use of ADCETRIS and bleomycin is contraindicated due to pulmonary toxicity (4).<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
