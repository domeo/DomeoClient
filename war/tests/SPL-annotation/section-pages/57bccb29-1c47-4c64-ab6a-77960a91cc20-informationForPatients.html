This may include topical corticosteroids or antibiotics with anti-inflammatory properties. These approaches were used in the NSCLC and pancreatic pivotal clinical trials. Acne preparations with drying properties may aggravate the dry skin and erythema. Treatment of rash has not been formally studied and should be based on rash severity. <BR>                  Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while taking TARCEVA  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].<BR>                  <BR>                  Smokers should be advised to stop smoking while taking TARCEVA as plasma concentrations of erlotinib are reduced due to the effect of cigarette smoking [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                  <BR>                    <BR>                   PRODUCT OF JAPAN OR  ITALY – See bottle label for origin<BR>                  <BR>                     Manufactured for:<BR>                  <BR>                  OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Farmingdale, NY 11735<BR>                  an affiliate of Astellas Pharma US, Inc.<BR>                  <BR>                     Manufactured by:<BR>                  <BR>                  Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Seymour, IN 47274<BR>                  <BR>                     Distributed by:<BR>                  <BR>                  Genentech USA, Inc., A Member of the Roche Group<BR>                  1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080-4990<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
