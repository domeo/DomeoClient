There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of carisoprodol.<BR>                              Since the sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricylic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse<BR>                           <BR>                              In post-marketing experience with carisoprodol, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. Most cases<BR>of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used carisoprodol in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been post-marketing adverse event reports of carisoprodol-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported<BR>following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of carisoprodol dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, carisoprodol should be used with caution in addiction prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and carisoprodol should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort. <BR>                              Carisoprodol, and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may cause dependence (see <BR>                                    CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<BR>                                 ).<BR>										<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Aspirin:<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions<BR>                           <BR>                              Aspirin can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. Aspirinassociated serious Gl adverse reactions can occur anywhere along the Gl tract, at any time, with or without warning symptoms.<BR>Patients at higher risk of aspirin-associated serious upper Gl adverse reactions include patients with a history of aspirin-associated Gl bleeding from ulcers (complicated ulcers), a history of aspirin-associated ulcers (uncomplicated ulcers), geriatric patients, patients with poor baseline health status, patients taking higher doses of aspirin, and patients taking concomitant anticoagulants, NSAIDs, and/or large amounts of alcohol. To minimize the risk for aspirin-associated Gl serious adverse reaction, the lowest effective aspirin dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              Aspirin may cause an increased risk of serious anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions, which can occur in patients without known prior exposure to aspirin (see <BR>                                    CONTRAINDICATIONS<BR>                                 ).
