Women of childbearing potential and their male partners should not receive ribavirin unless they are using effective contraception (2 reliable forms) during treatment with ribavirin and for 6 months after treatment. Systemic hormonal contraceptives may not be as effective in women while taking INCIVEK. Therefore, 2 alternative effective methods of contraception, including intrauterine devices and barrier methods, should be used in women during treatment with INCIVEK and concomitant ribavirin [see <BR>                                          Warnings and Precautions (5.3)<BR>                                       ].<BR>                                    <BR>                                       A Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry has been established to monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnancies in female patients and female partners of male patients exposed to ribavirin during treatment and for 6 months following cessation of treatment.

The highest doses tested produced exposures equal to 1.84- and 0.60-fold the exposures in humans at the recommended clinical dose, respectively. Telaprevir treatment alone had effects on fertility parameters in rats. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for testicular toxicity was established at exposures 0.17-fold the human exposures at the recommended clinical dose. Potential effects on sperm (e.g., decreased % motile sperm and increased non-motile sperm count) were observed in a rat fertility study at exposures 0.30-fold the human exposures at the recommended clinical dose. Additional effects on fertility include minor increases in percent preimplantation loss, in percent of dams with nonviable embryos and percent of nonviable conceptuses per litter. These effects are likely associated with testicular toxicity in male but contributions of the female cannot be ruled out. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women.<BR>                                    Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patientsâ€”both during treatment and for 6 months after the completion of all treatment. INCIVEK combination treatment should not be started unless a female patient has a negative pregnancy test immediately prior to initiation of treatment. Pregnancy testing should occur monthly during INCIVEK combination treatment and for 6 months after all treatment has ended [see <BR>                                          Contraindications (4)<BR>                                        and <BR>                                          Patient Counseling Information (17.2)<BR>                                       ]. Pregnancy testing in non-pregnant female partners is recommended before INCIVEK combination therapy, every month during INCIVEK combination therapy, and for 6 months after ribavirin therapy has ended.<BR>                                    Hormonal contraceptives may be continued but may not be reliable during INCIVEK dosing and for up to 2 weeks following cessation of INCIVEK [see <BR>                                          Drug Interactions (7)<BR>                                       ]. During this time, female patients of childbearing potential should use 2 effective non-hormonal methods of contraception. Examples may include barrier methods or IUDs [see also <BR>                                          Warnings and Precautions (5.3)<BR>                                        and <BR>                                          Patient Counseling Information (17.2)<BR>                                       ]. Refer also to the prescribing information for ribavirin.<BR>                                    Two weeks after completion of INCIVEK treatment, hormonal contraceptives are again appropriate as one of the 2 required effective methods of birth control; however, specific prescribing information recommendations should be followed for the contraceptives.

When administered to lactating rats, levels of telaprevir were higher in milk compared to those observed in plasma. Rat offspring exposed to telaprevir in utero showed no effects on body weight at birth. However, when fed via milk from telaprevir-treated dams, body weight gain of pups was lower than pups fed milk from control dams. After weaning, rat pup body weight gain was similar in offspring from telaprevir-treated and control dams. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, nursing must be discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.
