Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

In EM individuals treated with paroxetine or fluoxetine, the AUC of atomoxetine is approximately 6– to 8–fold and Css,max is about 3– to 4–fold greater than atomoxetine alone.<BR>                        In vitro studies suggest that coadministration of cytochrome P450 inhibitors to PMs will not increase the plasma concentrations of atomoxetine.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.3  Pressor Agents<BR>                     <BR>                        Because of possible effects on blood pressure, STRATTERA should be used cautiously with pressor agents (e.g., dopamine, dobutamine).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.4  Albuterol<BR>                     <BR>                        STRATTERA should be administered with caution to patients being treated with systemically–administered (oral or intravenous) albuterol (or other beta2 agonists) because the action of albuterol on the cardiovascular system can be potentiated resulting in increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Albuterol (600 mcg iv over 2 hours) induced increases in heart rate and blood pressure. These effects were potentiated by atomoxetine (60 mg BID for 5 days) and were most marked after the initial coadministration of albuterol and atomoxetine. However, these effects on heart rate and blood pressure were not seen in another study after the coadministration with inhaled dose of albuterol (200-800 mcg) and atomoxetine (80 mg QD for 5 days) in 21 healthy Asian subjects who were excluded for poor metabolizer status.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.5  Effect of Atomoxetine on P450 Enzymes<BR>                     <BR>                        Atomoxetine did not cause clinically important inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9.<BR>                        <BR>                           CYP3A Substrate (e.g., Midazolam) — Coadministration of STRATTERA (60 mg BID for 12 days) with midazolam, a model compound for CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (single dose of 5 mg), resulted in 15% increase in AUC of midazolam.
