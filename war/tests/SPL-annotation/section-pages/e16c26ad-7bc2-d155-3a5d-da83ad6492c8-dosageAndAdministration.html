Therefore, consideration should be given to the use of lower doses in this population (See<BR>                               CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<BR>                           and<BR>                              PRECAUTIONS<BR>                           ). <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
