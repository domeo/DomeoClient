Treatment of breast cancer thought to be hormonally <BR>responsive (i.e., estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive or receptor <BR>unknown) has included a variety of efforts to decrease estrogen levels <BR>(ovariectomy, adrenalectomy, hypophysectomy) or inhibit estrogen effects <BR>(antiestrogens and progestational agents). These interventions lead to decreased <BR>tumor mass or delayed progression of tumor growth in some women. <BR>                        In postmenopausal women, estrogens are mainly derived from the action of the <BR>aromatase enzyme, which converts adrenal androgens (primarily androstenedione <BR>and testosterone) to estrone and estradiol. The suppression of estrogen <BR>biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and in the cancer tissue itself can therefore <BR>be achieved by specifically inhibiting the aromatase enzyme. <BR>                        Letrozole is a non-steroidal competitive inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme <BR>system; it inhibits the conversion of androgens to estrogens. In adult nontumor- <BR>and tumor-bearing female animals, letrozole is as effective as ovariectomy in <BR>reducing uterine weight, elevating serum LH and causing the regression of <BR>estrogen-dependent tumors. In contrast to ovariectomy, treatment with letrozole <BR>does not lead to an increase in serum FSH. Letrozole selectively inhibits <BR>gonadal steroidogenesis but has no significant effect on adrenal <BR>mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid synthesis. <BR>                        Letrozole inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the heme <BR>of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of <BR>estrogen biosynthesis in all tissues. Treatment of women with letrozole <BR>significantly lowers serum estrone, estradiol and estrone sulfate and has not <BR>been shown to significantly affect adrenal corticosteroid synthesis, aldosterone <BR>synthesis, or synthesis of thyroid hormones. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics<BR>                     <BR>                        In postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer, daily <BR>doses of 0.1 mg to 5 mg letrozole suppress plasma concentrations of estradiol, <BR>estrone and estrone sulfate by 75% to 95% from baseline with maximal suppression <BR>achieved within 2 to 3 days. Suppression is dose related, with doses of 0.5 mg <BR>and higher giving many values of estrone and estrone sulfate that were below the <BR>limit of detection in the assays. Estrogen suppression was maintained throughout <BR>treatment in all patients treated at 0.5 mg or higher. <BR>                        Letrozole is highly specific in inhibiting aromatase activity. There is no <BR>impairment of adrenal steroidogenesis. No clinically-relevant changes were found <BR>in the plasma concentrations of cortisol, aldosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, <BR>17-hydroxy-progesterone, ACTH or in plasma renin activity among postmenopausal <BR>patients treated with a daily dose of letrozole 0.1 mg to 5 mg. The ACTH <BR>stimulation test performed after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment with daily doses of <BR>0.1 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2.5 mg and 5 mg did not indicate any attenuation <BR>of aldosterone or cortisol production. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid <BR>supplementation is, therefore, not necessary. <BR>                        No changes were noted in plasma concentrations of androgens (androstenedione <BR>and testosterone) among healthy postmenopausal women after 0.1 mg, 0.5 mg and <BR>2.5 mg single doses of letrozole or in plasma concentrations of androstenedione <BR>among postmenopausal patients treated with daily doses of 0.1 mg to 5 mg. This <BR>indicates that the blockade of estrogen biosynthesis does not lead to <BR>accumulation of androgenic precursors. Plasma levels of LH and FSH were not <BR>affected by letrozole in patients, nor was thyroid function as evaluated by TSH <BR>levels, T3 uptake, and T4 levels. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        Absorption and DistributionLetrozole is rapidly and completely absorbed from the <BR>gastrointestinal tract and absorption is not affected by food. It is metabolized <BR>slowly to an inactive metabolite whose glucuronide conjugate is excreted <BR>renally, representing the major clearance pathway. About 90% of radiolabeled <BR>letrozole is recovered in urine. Letrozoleâ€™s terminal elimination half-life is <BR>about 2 days and steady-state plasma concentration after daily 2.5 mg dosing is <BR>reached in 2 to 6 weeks. Plasma concentrations at steady-state are 1.5 to 2 <BR>times higher than predicted from the concentrations measured after a single <BR>dose, indicating a slight non-linearity in the pharmacokinetics of letrozole <BR>upon daily administration of 2.5 mg. These steady-state levels are maintained <BR>over extended periods, however, and continuous accumulation of letrozole does <BR>not occur. Letrozole is weakly protein bound and has a large volume of <BR>distribution (approximately 1.9 L/kg). <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Metabolism and ExcretionMetabolism to a pharmacologically-inactive carbinol metabolite <BR>(4,4'methanol-bisbenzonitrile) and renal excretion of the glucuronide conjugate <BR>of this metabolite is the major pathway of letrozole clearance. Of the <BR>radiolabel recovered in urine, at least 75% was the glucuronide of the carbinol <BR>metabolite, about 9% was two unidentified metabolites and 6% was unchanged <BR>letrozole. In human microsomes with specific CYP isozyme activity, CYP3A4 <BR>metabolized letrozole to the carbinol metabolite while CYP2A6 formed both this <BR>metabolite and its ketone analog. In human liver microsomes, letrozole strongly <BR>inhibited CYP2A6 and moderately inhibited CYP2C19. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Pediatric, Geriatric and RaceIn the study populations (adults ranging in age from 35 to > <BR>80 years), no change in pharmacokinetic parameters was observed with increasing <BR>age. Differences in letrozole pharmacokinetics between adult and pediatric <BR>populations have not been studied. Differences in letrozole pharmacokinetics due <BR>to race have not been studied. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Renal ImpairmentIn a study of volunteers with varying renal function (24-hour <BR>creatinine clearance: 9 to 116 mL/min), no effect of renal function on the <BR>pharmacokinetics of single doses of 2.5 mg of letrozole was found. In addition, <BR>in a study of 347 patients with advanced breast cancer, about half of whom <BR>received 2.5 mg letrozole and half 0.5 mg letrozole, renal impairment <BR>(calculated creatinine clearance: 20 to 50 mL/min) did not affect steady-state <BR>plasma letrozole concentrations. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Hepatic ImpairmentIn a study of subjects with mild to moderate non-metastatic <BR>hepatic dysfunction (e.g., cirrhosis, Child-Pugh classification A and B), the <BR>mean AUC values of the volunteers with moderate hepatic impairment were 37% <BR>higher than in normal subjects, but still within the range seen in subjects <BR>without impaired function. <BR>                        In a pharmacokinetic study, subjects with liver cirrhosis and severe hepatic <BR>impairment (Child-Pugh classification C, which included bilirubins about 2 to 11 <BR>times ULN with minimal to severe ascites) had 2-fold increase in exposure (AUC) <BR>and 47% reduction in systemic clearance. Breast cancer patients with severe <BR>hepatic impairment are thus expected to be exposed to higher levels of letrozole <BR>than patients with normal liver function receiving similar doses of this drug <BR>[see Dosage and <BR>Administration (2.5)]. <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
