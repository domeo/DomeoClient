The concurrent administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection with irradiation has not been adequately studied and is not recommended.<BR>                        Lymphocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving irinotecan hydrochloride injection, and it is possible that the administration of dexamethasone as antiemetic prophylaxis may have enhanced the likelihood of this effect. However, serious opportunistic infections have not been observed, and no complications have specifically been attributed to lymphocytopenia.<BR>                        Hyperglycemia has also been reported in patients receiving irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Usually, this has been observed in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus or evidence of glucose intolerance prior to administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. It is probable that dexamethasone, given as antiemetic prophylaxis, contributed to hyperglycemia in some patients.<BR>                        The incidence of akathisia in clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule was greater (8.5%, 4/47 patients) when prochlorperazine was administered on the same day as irinotecan hydrochloride injection than when these drugs were given on separate days (1.3%, 1/80 patients). The 8.5% incidence of akathisia, however, is within the range reported for use of prochlorperazine when given as a premedication for other chemotherapies.<BR>                        It would be expected that laxative use during therapy with irinotecan hydrochloride injection would worsen the incidence or severity of diarrhea, but this has not been studied.<BR>                        In view of the potential risk of dehydration secondary to vomiting and/or diarrhea induced by irinotecan hydrochloride injection, the physician may wish to withhold diuretics during dosing with irinotecan hydrochloride injection and, certainly, during periods of active vomiting or diarrhea.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               </P></DIV></HTML>
