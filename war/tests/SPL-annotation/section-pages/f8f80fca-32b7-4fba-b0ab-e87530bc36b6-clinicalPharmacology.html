The exposure-efficacy relationship was similar to that observed<BR>between dose and efficacy with median exposures at the two highest doses resulting<BR>in near maximal changes from baseline <BR>                              [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]<BR>                           .<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.3  Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        Atomoxetine is well–absorbed after oral administration and is minimally affected<BR>by food. It is eliminated primarily by oxidative metabolism through the cytochrome<BR>P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzymatic pathway and<BR>subsequent glucuronidation. Atomoxetine has a half–life of about 5 hours. A fraction of the<BR>population (about 7% of Caucasians and 2% of<BR>African Americans) are poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2D6<BR>metabolized drugs. These individuals have reduced activity in this pathway<BR>resulting in 10–fold higher AUCs, 5–fold higher peak plasma concentrations,<BR>and slower elimination (plasma half–life of about 24 hours)<BR>of atomoxetine compared<BR>with people with normal activity [extensive metabolizers (EMs)].<BR>Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and quinidine,<BR>cause similar increases in exposure.<BR>                        The pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine have<BR>been evaluated in more than 400 children and adolescents<BR>in selected clinical trials, primarily using population pharmacokinetic studies.<BR>Single–dose and steady–state individual pharmacokinetic data were<BR>also obtained in children, adolescents, and adults. When doses were normalized<BR>to a mg/kg basis, similar half–life, Cmax,<BR>and AUC values were observed in children, adolescents, and<BR>adults. Clearance and volume of distribution after adjustment for body weight<BR>were also similar.<BR>                        <BR>                           Absorption<BR>and distribution — Atomoxetine is<BR>rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with absolute bioavailability<BR>of about 63% in EMs and 94% in PMs. Maximal<BR>plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached<BR>approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing.<BR>                        STRATTERA can<BR>be administered with or without food. Administration of STRATTERA with<BR>a standard high–fat meal in adults did not affect the extent of oral<BR>absorption of atomoxetine (AUC), but did decrease the rate of absorption, resulting in a 37% lower<BR>Cmax, and delayed Tmax by 3 hours.<BR>In clinical trials with children and adolescents, administration of STRATTERA with<BR>food resulted in a 9% lower Cmax.<BR>                        The steady–state volume of distribution<BR>after intravenous administration is 0.85 L/kg indicating<BR>that atomoxetine distributes<BR>primarily into total body water. Volume of distribution is similar across<BR>the patient weight range after normalizing for body weight.<BR>                        At therapeutic concentrations, 98% of atomoxetine in<BR>plasma is bound to protein, primarily albumin.<BR>                        <BR>                           Metabolism<BR>and elimination — Atomoxetine is<BR>metabolized primarily through the CYP2D6 enzymatic pathway. People with reduced<BR>activity in this pathway (PMs) have higher plasma concentrations<BR>of atomoxetine compared<BR>with people with normal activity (EMs). For PMs, AUC of atomoxetine is<BR>approximately 10–fold and Css,max is about 5–fold<BR>greater than EMs. Laboratory tests are available to identify CYP2D6 PMs.<BR>Coadministration of STRATTERA with<BR>potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, or quinidine,<BR>results in a substantial increase in atomoxetine plasma<BR>exposure, and dosing adjustment may be necessary <BR>                              [see Warnings and Precautions<BR>(5.13)]<BR>                           . Atomoxetine did<BR>not inhibit or induce the CYP2D6 pathway.<BR>                        The major oxidative metabolite formed, regardless<BR>of CYP2D6 status, is 4–hydroxyatomoxetine,<BR>which is glucuronidated. 4–Hydroxyatomoxetine is<BR>equipotent to atomoxetine as<BR>an inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter but circulates in plasma at<BR>much lower concentrations (1% of atomoxetine concentration in EMs and 0.1% of atomoxetine concentration<BR>in PMs). 4–Hydroxyatomoxetine is primarily formed by CYP2D6, but in PMs, 4–hydroxyatomoxetine is<BR>formed at a slower rate by several other cytochrome P450<BR>enzymes. N–Desmethylatomoxetine is formed by CYP2C19 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes,<BR>but has substantially less pharmacological activity compared with atomoxetine and<BR>circulates in plasma at lower concentrations (5% of atomoxetine concentration<BR>in EMs and 45% of atomoxetine concentration<BR>in PMs).<BR>                        Mean apparent plasma clearance of atomoxetine after<BR>oral administration in adult EMs is 0.35 L/hr/kg and the<BR>mean half–life is 5.2 hours. Following oral administration<BR>of atomoxetine to<BR>PMs, mean apparent plasma clearance is 0.03 L/hr/kg and mean<BR>half–life is 21.6 hours. For PMs, AUC of atomoxetine is<BR>approximately 10–fold and Css,max is about 5–fold<BR>greater than EMs. The elimination half–life of 4–hydroxyatomoxetine is<BR>similar to that of N–desmethylatomoxetine (6 to 8 hours)<BR>in EM subjects, while the half–life of N–desmethylatomoxetine is<BR>much longer in PM subjects (34 to 40 hours).<BR>                        Atomoxetine is excreted primarily as 4–hydroxyatomoxetine-O-glucuronide,<BR>mainly in the urine (greater than 80% of the dose) and to<BR>a lesser extent in the feces (less than 17% of the dose).<BR>Only a small fraction of the STRATTERA dose<BR>is excreted as unchanged atomoxetine (less than 3% of the dose), indicating extensive biotransformation.<BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              [See Use In Specific Populations<BR>(8.4,<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              8.5,<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              8.6, <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              8.7,<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              8.8, <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              8.9)]<BR>									.<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
