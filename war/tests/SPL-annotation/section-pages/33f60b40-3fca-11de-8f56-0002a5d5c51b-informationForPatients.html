Patients should be counseled not to take FANAPT with other drugs that cause QT interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].   Patients should be told to inform physicians that they are taking FANAPT before any new drug is taken.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.2	Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients and caregivers should be counseled that a potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as NMS has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Signs and symptoms of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.3	Orthostatic Hypotension<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be advised of the risk of orthostatic hypotension, particularly at the time of initiating treatment, re-initiating treatment, or increasing the dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.4	Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance<BR>                     <BR>                        Because FANAPT may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that FANAPT therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.5	Pregnancy<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with FANAPT [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.6	Nursing<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking FANAPT [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.7	Concomitant Medication<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.8	Alcohol<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking FANAPT.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.9	Heat Exposure and Dehydration<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration.<BR><BR>                           <BR><BR>                           <BR><BR>                        <BR>                        FANAPT is a trademark of Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.<BR>                        Distributed by Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.
