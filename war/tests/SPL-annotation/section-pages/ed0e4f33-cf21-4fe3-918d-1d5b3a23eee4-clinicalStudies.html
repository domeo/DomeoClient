Subjects in these trials had compensated liver disease, detectable HCV RNA, and liver histopathology consistent with chronic hepatitis C. In all 3 trials, INCIVEK was administered at a dosage of 750 mg every 8 hours; the peginterferon alfa-2a (Peg-IFN-alfa-2a) dose was 180 micrograms per week, and the ribavirin (RBV) dose was 1000 mg per day (subjects weighing less than 75 kg) or 1200 mg per day (subjects weighing greater than or equal to 75 kg). Plasma HCV RNA values were measured during the clinical trials using the COBAS® TaqMan® HCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System. The assay had a lower limit of quantitation of 25 IU per mL. SVR was defined as HCV RNA less than 25 IU per mL at last observation within the SVR visit window (i.e., weeks 32-78 for patients assigned to 24 weeks of treatment and weeks 56-78 for patients assigned to 48 weeks of treatment).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     14.2 Treatment-Naïve Adults<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Trial 108 (ADVANCE)<BR>                              <BR>                              Trial 108 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial conducted in treatment-naïve subjects (had received no prior therapy for HCV, including interferon or pegylated interferon monotherapy). INCIVEK was given for the first 8 weeks of treatment (T8/PR regimen) or the first 12 weeks of treatment (T12/PR regimen) in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV for either 24 or 48 weeks. Subjects who had undetectable HCV RNA (Target Not Detected) at weeks 4 and 12 (extended Rapid Virologic Response [eRVR]) received 24 weeks of Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV treatment, and subjects who did not have undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 4 and 12 (no eRVR) received 48 weeks of Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV treatment. The control regimen (Pbo/PR48) had a fixed treatment duration, with telaprevir-matching placebo for the first 12 weeks and Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV for 48 weeks.<BR>                              The 1088

The trial enrolled prior relapsers (subjects with HCV RNA undetectable at end of treatment with a pegylated interferon-based regimen, but HCV RNA detectable within 24 weeks of treatment follow-up) and prior non-responders (subjects who did not have undetectable HCV RNA levels during or at the end of a prior course of at least 12 weeks of treatment). The nonresponder population included 2 subgroups: prior partial responders (greater than or equal to 2-log10 reduction in HCV RNA at week 12, but not achieving HCV RNA undetectable at end of treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin) and prior null responders (less than 2-log10 reduction in HCV RNA at week 12 of prior treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin).<BR>                              Subjects were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of 2 INCIVEK combination treatment groups (with and without a Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV lead-in) or a control group. The T12/PR48 group received INCIVEK and Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV for 12 weeks (without a lead-in), followed by placebo and Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV for 4 weeks, followed by Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV for 32 weeks. The T12(DS)/PR48 group had a lead-in (delayed start of INCIVEK) with placebo and Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV for 4 weeks, followed by INCIVEK and Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV for 12 weeks, followed by Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV for 32 weeks. The Pbo/PR48 group received placebo and Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV for 16 weeks, followed by Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV for 32 weeks.<BR>                              The 662 enrolled subjects had a median age of 51 years (range: 21 to 70); 70% of the subjects were male; 26% had a body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2; 5% were Black; 11% were Hispanic or Latino; 89% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than 800,000 IU per mL; 22% had bridging fibrosis; 26% had cirrhosis; 54% had HCV genotype 1a, and 46% had HCV genotype 1b. Null and partial responders had higher baseline HCV RNA levels and more advanced liver disease (cirrhosis) than relapsers; other characteristics were similar across these populations.<BR>                              The lead-in and immediate start regimens produced comparable SVR and no SVR rates, so data from these 2 groups were pooled (Table 11).<BR>                              <BR><BR><table
