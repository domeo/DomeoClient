The risks of secondary infection and neoplasia are also significant (see <BR>                        WARNINGS). The frequency and severity of adverse reactions depend on the dose and duration of azathioprine tablets as well as on the patientâ€™s underlying disease or concomitant therapies. The incidence of hematologic toxicities and neoplasia encountered in groups of renal homograft recipients is significantly higher than that in studies employing azathioprine tablets for rheumatoid arthritis. The relative incidences in clinical studies are summarized below:<BR>                  <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ID="ID267" width="101%"><BR>                     <col width="35%"/><BR>                     <col width="31%"/><BR>                     <col width="35%"/><BR>                     <thead><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td align="left" valign="middle" colspan="1" styleCode=" Rrule Botrule Toprule"><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Toxicity</content><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold"/><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td align="left" valign="middle" colspan="1" styleCode=" Lrule Rrule Botrule Toprule"><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Renal </content><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Homograft</content><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold"/><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td align="left" valign="middle" colspan="1" styleCode=" Lrule Botrule Toprule"><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Rheumatoid </content><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Arthritis</content><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold"/><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                     </thead><BR>                     <tbody><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td align="left" valign="middle" styleCode=" Rrule Botrule Toprule">Leukopenia (any degree)</td><BR>                           <td align="center" valign="middle" styleCode=" Lrule Rrule Botrule Toprule">&gt;50%</td><BR>                           <td align="center" valign="middle" styleCode=" Lrule Botrule Toprule">28%</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td align="left" valign="middle" styleCode=" Rrule Botrule Toprule">&lt;2,500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td align="center" valign="middle" styleCode=" Lrule Rrule Botrule Toprule">16%</td><BR>                           <td align="center" valign="middle" styleCode=" Lrule Botrule Toprule">5.3%</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td align="left" valign="middle" styleCode=" Rrule Botrule Toprule">Infections</td><BR>                           <td align="center" valign="middle" styleCode=" Lrule Rrule Botrule Toprule">20%</td><BR>                           <td align="center" valign="middle" styleCode=" Lrule Botrule Toprule">&lt;1%</td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td align="left" valign="middle" styleCode=" Rrule Toprule">Neoplasia</td><BR>                           <td align="center" valign="middle" styleCode=" Lrule Toprule"/><BR>                           <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode=" Toprule"/><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td align="left" valign="middle" styleCode=" Rrule">Lymphoma</td><BR>                           <td align="center" valign="middle" styleCode=" Lrule">0.5%</td><BR>                           <td align="center" valign="top"><BR>                              <sup>*</sup><BR>                           </td><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td align="left" valign="middle" styleCode=" Rrule Botrule">Others</td><BR>                           <td align="center" valign="middle" styleCode=" Lrule Botrule">2.8%</td><BR>                           <td align="center" valign="top" styleCode=" Botrule"/><BR>                        </tr><BR>                     </tbody><BR>                  </table><BR>               <BR><BR><BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     Hematologic<BR>                     <BR>                        Leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia are dose-dependent and may occur late in the course of therapy with azathioprine tablets. Dose reduction or temporary withdrawal may result in reversal of these toxicities. Infection may occur as a secondary manifestation of bone marrow suppression or leukopenia, but the incidence of infection in renal homotransplantation is 30 to 60 times that in rheumatoid arthritis. Macrocytic anemia and/or bleeding have been reported.<BR>                        TPMT genotyping or phenotyping can help identify patients with low or absent TPMT activity (homozygous for non-functional alleles) who are at increased risk for severe, life-threatening myelosuppression from azathioprine tablets (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS<BR>                           and <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests).

The frequency of gastric disturbance often can be reduced by administration of the drug in divided doses and/or after meals. However, in some patients, nausea and vomiting may be severe and may be accompanied by symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, malaise, and myalgias (see <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS). Vomiting with abdominal pain may occur rarely with a hypersensitivity pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity manifest by elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and/or serum transaminases is known to occur following azathioprine use, primarily in allograft recipients. Hepatotoxicity has been uncommon (less than 1%) in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Hepatotoxicity following transplantation most often occurs within 6 months of transplantation and is generally reversible after interruption of azathioprine tablets. A rare, but life-threatening hepatic veno-occlusive disease associated with chronic administration of azathioprine has been described in transplant patients and in one patient receiving azathioprine tablets for panuveitis.21, 22, 23 Periodic measurement of serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin is indicated for early detection of hepatotoxicity. If hepatic veno-occlusive disease is clinically suspected, azathioprine tablets should be permanently withdrawn. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     Others<BR>                     <BR>                        Additional side effects of low frequency have been reported.
