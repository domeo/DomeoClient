Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of ARCAPTA NEOHALER during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3     Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        It is not known that the active component of ARCAPTA NEOHALER, indacaterol, is excreted in human milk.  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because indacaterol has been detected in the milk of lactating rats, caution should be exercised when ARCAPTA NEOHALER is administered to nursing women.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4     Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        ARCAPTA NEOHALER is not indicated for use in children. The safety and effectiveness of ARCAPTA NEOHALER in pediatric patients have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5     Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Based on available data, no adjustment of ARCAPTA NEOHALER dosage in geriatric patients is warranted.  Of the total number of patients who received ARCAPTA NEOHALER at the recommended dose of 75 mcg once daily in the clinical studies from the pooled 3-month database, 239 were <65 years, 153 were 65–74 years and 57 were ≥75 years of age. <BR>                        No overall differences in effectiveness were observed, and in the 3-month pooled data, the adverse drug reaction profile was similar in the older population compared to the patient population overall.  When treated at higher doses (300 mcg and 600 mcg) over the course of a year, the adverse drug reaction profiles for patients >65 years was similar to that of the general patient population.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.6     Hepatic Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed no relevant changes in Cmax or AUC, nor did protein binding differ between mild and moderate hepatically impaired subjects and their healthy controls. Studies in subjects with severe hepatic impairment were not performed.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.7     Renal Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        Due to the very low contribution of the urinary pathway to total body elimination, a study in renally impaired subjects was not performed. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
