The average duration of treatment with encainide or flecainide in this study was 10 months.<BR>                     <BR>                        •The applicability of the CAST results to other populations (e.g., those without recent myocardial infarction) or other antiarrhythmic drugs is uncertain, but at present, it is prudent to consider any IC antiarrhythmic to have a significant proarrhythmic risk in patients with structural heart disease. Given the lack of any evidence that these drugs improve survival, antiarrhythmic agents should generally be avoided in patients with non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, even if the patients are experiencing unpleasant, but not life-threatening, symptoms or signs.<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        WARNING: MORTALITY<BR>                        <BR>                           See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              •An increased rate of death or reversed cardiac arrest rate was seen in patients treated with encainide or flecainide (Class IC antiarrhythmics) compared with that seen in patients assigned to placebo.
