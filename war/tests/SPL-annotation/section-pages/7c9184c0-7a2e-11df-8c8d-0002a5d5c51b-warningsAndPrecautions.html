There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of Carisoprodol.<BR>                        Since the sedative effects of Carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.2  Abuse, Dependence and Withdrawal<BR>                     <BR>                        Carisoprodol, the active ingredient in the tablets, has been subject to abuse, dependence, withdrawal, misuse and criminal diversion [<BR>                              see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1,<BR>                               9.2,<BR>                               9.3)<BR>                           ].  Abuse of Carisprodol poses a risk of overdosage which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and other disorders [<BR>                              see Overdosage (10)<BR>                           ].<BR>                        Post-marketing experience cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of drug abuse.  Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol after prolonged use. Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis.  One of carisoprodolâ€™s metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [<BR>                              see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           ].<BR>                        To reduce the risk of Carisoprodol abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing.  After prescribing limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.3 	Seizures<BR>                     <BR>                        There have been post-marketing reports of seizures in patients who received Carisoprodol. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [<BR>                              see Overdosage (10)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
