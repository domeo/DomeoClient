The dosage, therefore, should be individualized for maximum beneficial effects. The usual maintenance dose is 1 or 2 capsules, 3 or 4 times a day administered before meals and at bedtime.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Geriatric Dosing<BR>                     <BR>                        Dosage should be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia, oversedation or confusion. The initial dose should not exceed 2 Chlordiazepoxide HCl/Clidinium Bromide capsules per day, to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
