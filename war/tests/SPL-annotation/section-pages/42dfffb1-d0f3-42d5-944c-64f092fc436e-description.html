It is produced in an E. coli expression system and has a molecular weight of 58 kD. Neomycin is used in the fermentation process but is undetectable in the final product. Ontak is supplied in single use vials as a sterile, frozen solution intended for intravenous (IV) administration. Each 2 mL vial of Ontak contains 300 mcg of recombinant denileukin diftitox in a sterile solution of citric acid (20 mM), EDTA (0.05 mM) and polysorbate 20 (<1%) in Water for Injection, USP. The solution has a pH range of 6.9 to 7.2.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
