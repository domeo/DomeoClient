Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related <BR>changes of a loss of 1-2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes <BR>(2-12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD <BR>deficient patients have greater responses. <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Nervous System Effects: Peripheral <BR>neuropathy is a definite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in <BR>non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, <BR>Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially <BR>complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some <BR>recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this <BR>complication may be difficult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. <BR><BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Body As A Whole: In addition to the <BR>warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions <BR>include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred <BR>vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary <BR>eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia <BR>without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug-induced <BR>Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. In general, <BR>with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage <BR>(retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed <BR>off drug. <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
