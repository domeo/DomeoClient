A clinically important XELODA-Warfarin drug interaction was demonstrated in a clinical pharmacology trial (see <BR>                        CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<BR>                      and <BR>                        PRECAUTIONS<BR>                     ). Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding, including death, have been reported in patients taking XELODA concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and phenprocoumon. Postmarketing reports have shown clinically significant increases in prothrombin time (PT) and INR in patients who were stabilized on anticoagulants at the time XELODA was introduced. These events occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating XELODA therapy and, in a few cases, within 1 month after stopping XELODA. These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases. Age greater than 60 and a diagnosis of cancer independently predispose patients to an increased risk of coagulopathy.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
