Each 50 mL or 100 mL amber vial of infusion concentrate contains: 1 mg/mL cisplatin, 9 mg/mL sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide to adjust pH, and water for injection to a final volume of 50 mL or 100 mL, respectively. The pH range of Cisplatin Injection is 3.5 to 6.5.<BR>                  Cisplatin injection infusion concentrate must be further diluted prior to administration (see <BR>                        DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: All Patients).<BR>                  <BR>                  The active ingredient, cisplatin, is a yellow to orange crystalline powder with the molecular formula PtCl2H6N2, and a molecular weight of 300.1. Cisplatin is a heavy metal complex containing a central atom of platinum surrounded by two chloride atoms and two ammonia molecules in the cis position. It is soluble in water or saline at 1 mg/mL and in dimethylformamide at 24 mg/mL. It has a melting point of 207° C.           <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     structure<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
