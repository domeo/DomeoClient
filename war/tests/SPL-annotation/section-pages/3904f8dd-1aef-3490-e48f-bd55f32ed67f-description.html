Approximately 4 molecules of MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule. Brentuximab vedotin is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis.<BR>                  ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) for Injection is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free lyophilized cake or powder in single-use vials. Following reconstitution with 10.5 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, a solution containing 5 mg/mL brentuximab vedotin is produced. The reconstituted product contains 70 mg/mL trehalose dihydrate, 5.6 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.21 mg/mL citric acid monohydrate, and 0.20 mg/mL polysorbate 80 and water for injection. The pH is approximately 6.6.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
