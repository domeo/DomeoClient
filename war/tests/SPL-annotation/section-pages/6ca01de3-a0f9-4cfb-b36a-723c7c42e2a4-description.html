These agents are competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme catalyzing the early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. <BR>                  Pravastatin sodium USP is designated chemically as 1-Naphthalene-heptanoic acid, 1,2,6,7,8,8a-hexahydro-β,δ,6-trihydroxy-2-methyl-8-(2-methyl-1-oxobutoxy)-, monosodium salt, [1S[1α(βS*,δS*),2α,6α,8β(R*),8aα]]-. <BR>                  Structural formula:<BR>                  <BR>                     C23H35NaO7     MW 446.52<BR>                  <BR>                  Pravastatin sodium USP is an odorless, white to off-white, fine or crystalline powder. It is a relatively polar hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient (octanol/water) of 0.59 at a pH of 7. It is soluble in methanol and water (>300 mg/mL), slightly soluble in isopropanol, and practically insoluble in acetone, acetonitrile, chloroform, and ether. <BR>                  Pravastatin sodium tablets USP are available for oral administration as 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablets. Inactive ingredients include: colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, meglumine, microcrystalline cellulose and starch. The 10 mg, 20 mg and 80 mg tablets also contain D&C yellow no. 10 aluminum lake and the 40 mg tablet also contains D&C yellow no. 10 aluminum lake and FD&C blue no. 1 aluminum lake.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     pravastatin sodium chemical structure<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
