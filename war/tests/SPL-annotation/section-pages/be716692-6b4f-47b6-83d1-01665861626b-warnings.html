Irinotecan hydrochloride injection should be used as recommended (see <BR>                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION<BR>                           ).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Diarrhea<BR>                     <BR>                        Irinotecan hydrochloride injection can induce both early and late forms of diarrhea that appear to be mediated by different mechanisms. Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan hydrochloride injection) is cholinergic in nature. It is usually transient and only infrequently is severe. It may be accompanied by symptoms of rhinitis, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, diaphoresis, flushing, and intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal cramping. Early diarrhea and other cholinergic symptoms may be prevented or ameliorated by administration of atropine (see <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS, General<BR>                           , for dosing recommendations for atropine).<BR>                        Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of CAMPTOSAR) can be life threatening since it may be prolonged and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis. Late diarrhea should be treated promptly with loperamide (see <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients<BR>                           , for dosing recommendations for loperamide). Patients with diarrhea should be carefully monitored, should be given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated, and should be given antibiotic support if they develop ileus, fever, or severe neutropenia. After the first treatment, subsequent weekly chemotherapy treatments should be delayed in patients until return of pretreatment bowel function for at least 24 hours without need for anti-diarrhea medication. If grade 2, 3, or 4 late diarrhea occurs subsequent doses of CAMPTOSAR should be decreased within the current cycle (see<BR>                               DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION<BR>                           ).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Neutropenia<BR>                     <BR>                        Deaths due to sepsis following severe neutropenia have been reported in patients treated with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Neutropenic complications should be managed promptly with antibiotic support (see <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS<BR>                           ). Therapy with irinotecan hydrochloride injection should be temporarily omitted during a cycle of therapy if neutropenic fever occurs or if the absolute neutrophil count drops <1000/mm3. After the patient recovers to an absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/mm3, subsequent doses of CAMPTOSAR should be reduced depending upon the level of neutropenia observed (see <BR>                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION<BR>                           ).<BR>                        Routine administration of a colony-stimulating factor (CSF) is not necessary, but physicians may wish to consider CSF use in individual patients experiencing significant neutropenia.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Patients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity<BR>                     <BR>                        Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (UGT1A1 7/7 genotype) are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of irinotecan hydrochloride injection treatment. <BR>                        In a study of 66 patients who received single-agent irinotecan hydrochloride injection (350 mg/m2 once-every-3-weeks), the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele was 50%, and in patients heterozygous for this allele (UGT1A1 6/7 genotype) the incidence was 12.5%. No grade 4 neutropenia was observed in patients homozygous for the wild-type allele (UGT1A1 6/6 genotype). When administered in combination with other agents, or as a single-agent, a reduction in the starting dose by at least one level of CAMPTOSAR should be considered for patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. However, the precise dose reduction in this patient population is not known and subsequent dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient tolerance to treatment (see <BR>                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION<BR>                            and <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests<BR>                           ). <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Hypersensitivity<BR>                     <BR>                        Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Colitis/Ileus<BR>                     <BR>                        Cases of colitis complicated by ulceration, bleeding, ileus, and infection have been observed. Patients experiencing ileus should receive prompt antibiotic support (see <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS<BR>                           ).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Renal Impairment/Renal Failure<BR>                     <BR>                        Rare cases of renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Thromboembolism<BR>                     <BR>                        Thromboembolic events have been observed in patients receiving irinotecan-containing regimens; the specific cause of these events has not been determined. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Pulmonary Toxicity<BR>                     <BR>                        Interstitial Pulmonary Disease (IPD)-like events, including fatalities, have been reported in patients receiving irinotecan for treatment of colorectal cancer and other advanced solid tumors. In the event of an acute onset of new or progressive, unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, irinotecan and other co-prescribed chemotherapeutic agents should be interrupted pending diagnostic evaluation. If IPD is diagnosed, irinotecan and other chemotherapy should be discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as needed (see <BR>                              ADVERSE REACTIONS: Overview of Adverse Events: Respiratory<BR>                           ).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Pregnancy<BR>                     <BR>                        Irinotecan hydrochloride injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Radioactivity related to 14C-irinotecan crosses the placenta of rats following intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg (which in separate studies produced an irinotecan Cmax and AUC about 3 and 0.5 times, respectively, the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg/m2). Administration of 6 mg/kg/day intravenous irinotecan to rats (which in separate studies produced an irinotecan Cmax and AUC about 2 and 0.2 times, respectively, the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg/m2) and rabbits (about one-half the recommended human weekly starting dose on a mg/m2 basis) during the period of organogenesis, is embryotoxic as characterized by increased post-implantation loss and decreased numbers of live fetuses. Irinotecan was teratogenic in rats at doses greater than 1.2 mg/kg/day (which in separate studies produced an irinotecan Cmax and AUC about 2/3 and 1/40th, respectively, of the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg/m2) and in rabbits at 6.0 mg/kg/day (about one-half the recommended human weekly starting dose on a mg/m2 basis). Teratogenic effects included a variety of external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities. Irinotecan administered to rat dams for the period following organogenesis through weaning at doses of 6 mg/kg/day caused decreased learning ability and decreased female body weights in the offspring. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of irinotecan in pregnant women. If the drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with irinotecan hydrochloride injection.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
