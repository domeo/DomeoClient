(see ADVERSE REACTIONS).<BR>                  <BR>                     Animal Fetotoxicity.  Oral administration of clomiPHENE citrate to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day resulted in hydramnion and weak, edematous fetuses with wavy ribs and other temporary bone changes.  Doses of 8 mg/kg/day or more also caused increased resorptions and dead fetuses, dystocia, and delayed parturition, and 40 mg/kg/day resulted in increased maternal mortality.  Single doses of 50 mg/kg caused fetal cataracts, while 200 mg/kg caused cleft palate.<BR>                  Following injection of clomiPHENE citrate 2 mg/kg to mice and rats during pregnancy, the offspring exhibited metaplastic changes of the reproductive tract.  Newborn mice and rats injected during the first few days of life also developed metaplastic changes in uterine and vaginal mucosa, as well as premature vaginal opening and anovulatory ovaries.  These findings are similar to the abnormal reproductive behavior and sterility described with other estrogens and antiestrogens.<BR>                  In rabbits, some temporary bone alterations were seen in fetuses from dams given oral doses of 20 or 40 mg/kg/day during pregnancy, but not following 8 mg/kg/day.  No permanent malformations were observed in those studies.  Also, rhesus monkeys given oral doses of 1.5 to 4.5 mg/kg/day for various periods during pregnancy did not have any abnormal offspring.<BR>                  <BR>                     Liver Disease.  ClomiPHENE citrate therapy is contraindicated in patients with liver disease or a history of liver dysfunction (see also INDICATIONS AND USAGE and ADVERSE REACTIONS).<BR>                  <BR>                     Abnormal Uterine Bleeding.  ClomiPHENE citrate is contraindicated in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding of undetermined origin (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).<BR>                  <BR>                     Ovarian Cysts.  ClomiPHENE citrate is contraindicated in patients with ovarian cysts or enlargement not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS).<BR>                  <BR>                     Other.  ClomiPHENE citrate is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled thyroid or adrenal dysfunction or in the presence of an organic intracranial lesion such as pituitary tumor (see INDICATIONS and USAGE).<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
