Inappropriate behavior and other adverse behavioral effects have been reported when using benzodiazepines. Should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued. They are more likely to occur in children and in the elderly.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Urogenital System:<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                         incontinence, changes in libido, urinary retention<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Skin and Appendages:<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        skin reactions<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Laboratories:<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        elevated transaminases and alkaline phosphatase<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Other:<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        changes in salivation, including dry mouth, hypersalivation<BR>                        Antegrade amnesia may occur using therapeutic dosages, the risk increasing at higher dosages.
