Reproductive toxicity studies in rabbits treated during organogenesis with approximately 10 to 100 times the recommended human dose of rasburicase resulted in teratogenicity, including decreased fetal body weights and heart and great vessel malformations at all dose levels. Multiple heart and great vessel malformations were also observed in offspring of pregnant rats treated with approximately 250 times the recommended human dose of rasburicase. Other adverse effects were observed in rasburicase-treated pregnant rabbits at all dose levels tested and included pre- and post-implantation losses, abortions, and decreased uterine weights [See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.3)].<BR>                              <BR>                              It is unknown whether rasburicase can cross the placental barrier in humans and result in fetal harm. Because of the observed teratogenic effects of rasburicase in animal reproductive studies, use rasburicase during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3	Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        It is not known whether rasburicase is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from rasburicase, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue rasburicase, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4	Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        The safety and efficacy of Elitek was studied in 246 pediatric patients ranging in age from 1 month to 17 years. There were insufficient numbers of patients between 0 and 6 months (n=7) to determine whether they respond differently from older children. Mean uric acid AUC0–96 hr was higher in children <2 years of age (n=24; 150 ± s.e. 16 mg hr/dL) than those age 2 to 17 years (n=222; 108 ± s.e. 4 mg hr/dL). Children <2 years of age had a lower rate of achieving normal uric acid concentration by 48 hours [83% (95% CI: 62, 95)] than those 2 to 17 years [93% (95% CI: 89, 95)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5	Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Of the total number of adults treated with Elitek (n=434) in clinical studies, 30% were aged 65 and over while 8% were aged 75 and over. No overall differences in pharmacokinetics, safety, and effectiveness were observed between the elderly and younger patients.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
