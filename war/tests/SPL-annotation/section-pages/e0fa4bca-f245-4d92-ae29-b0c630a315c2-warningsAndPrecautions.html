Patients with a history or evidence of interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, were excluded from most clinical trials. Therefore, the estimated risk in a general population that includes such patients is uncertain. Cases of ILD, including fatalities, have been reported in patients treated with Vectibix. Interrupt Vectibix therapy for the acute onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms.
