Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be closely monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Dosing should be interrupted in patients with ALT or AST of greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Following resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming KALYDECO dosing. (5.1, 6)<BR>                           Use with CYP3A inducers: Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's Wort) substantially decreases exposure of ivacaftor which may diminish effectiveness. Therefore, co-administration is not recommended.
