Concomitant use of ZELBORAF with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 is not recommended as ZELBORAF may alter their concentrations.  If coadministration cannot be avoided, exercise caution and consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 substrate drug. <BR>                        Coadministration of vemurafenib resulted in an 18% increase in AUC of S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  Exercise caution and consider additional INR monitoring when ZELBORAF is used concomitantly with warfarin.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.2	Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP3A4<BR>                     <BR>                        Based on in vitro data, vemurafenib is a substrate of CYP3A4, and therefore, concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may alter vemurafenib concentrations.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, voriconazole) and inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) should be used with caution when coadministered with ZELBORAF.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
