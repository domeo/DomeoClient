Radioactivity related to 14C-exemestane <BR>crossed the placenta of rats following oral administration of 1 mg/kg <BR>exemestane. The concentration of exemestane and its metabolites was <BR>approximately equivalent in maternal and fetal blood. When rats were <BR>administered exemestane from 14 days prior to mating until either days 15 or 20 <BR>of gestation, and resuming for the 21 days of lactation, an increase in <BR>placental weight was seen at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5 times the <BR>recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2 basis). Prolonged <BR>gestation and abnormal or difficult labor was observed at doses equal to or <BR>greater than 20 mg/kg/day. Increased resorption, reduced number of live fetuses, <BR>decreased fetal weight, and retarded ossification were also observed at these <BR>doses. No malformations were noted when exemestane was administered to pregnant <BR>rats during the organogenesis period at doses up to 810 mg/kg/day (approximately <BR>320 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis). <BR>Daily doses of exemestane, given to rabbits during organogenesis caused a <BR>decrease in placental weight at 90 mg/kg/day (approximately 70 times the <BR>recommended human daily dose on a mg/m2 basis). <BR>Abortions, an increase in resorptions, and a reduction in fetal body weight were <BR>seen at 270 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of malformations <BR>in rabbits at doses up to 270 mg/kg/day (approximately 210 times the recommended <BR>human dose on a mg/m2 basis).<BR>                  There are no studies in pregnant women using AROMASIN. AROMASIN is indicated <BR>for postmenopausal women. If there is exposure to AROMASIN during pregnancy, the <BR>patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and potential <BR>risk for loss of the pregnancy.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
