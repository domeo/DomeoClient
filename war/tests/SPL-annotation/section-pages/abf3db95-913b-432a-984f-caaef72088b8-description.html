Its empirical formula is C17H19N3O3S, with a molecular weight of 345.42. The structural formula is:<BR>                  <BR>                     Omeprazole Chemical Structure<BR>                  <BR>                  Omeprazole is a white to off-white crystalline powder which melts with decomposition at about 155°C. It is a weak base, freely soluble in ethanol and methanol, and slightly soluble in acetone and isopropanol and very slightly soluble in water. The stability of omeprazole is a function of pH; it is rapidly degraded in acid media, but has acceptable stability under alkaline conditions. <BR>                  Omeprazole delayed-release capsules meets USP Drug release test 2.          <BR>                  Omeprazole is supplied as delayed-release capsules for oral administration. Each delayed-release capsule contains either 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg of omeprazole in the form of            enteric-coated granules with the following inactive ingredients: crospovidone, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, meglumine, methacrylic acid copolymer, poloxamer, povidone and triethyl citrate.          <BR>                  The capsule shells contains: D&C Red No. 28, FD&C Blue No. 1, FD&C Red No. 40, FD&C Yellow No. 6, yellow iron oxide, gelatin, silicon dioxide, sodium lauryl sulphate and titanium dioxide. Imprinting ink contains: D&C Yellow No. 10 aluminum lake, FD&C Blue No. 1 aluminum lake, FD&C Blue No. 2 aluminum lake, FD&C Red No. 40 aluminum lake, n-butyl alcohol, pharmaceutical glaze, propylene glycol, SDA-3A alcoho and synthetic black iron oxide.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     Omeprazole Chemical Structure<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
