Patients were randomized to one of the following <BR>three treatment groups: KAPIDEX 60 mg daily, KAPIDEX 90 mg daily or lansoprazole <BR>30 mg daily. Patients who were H pylori positive or <BR>who had Barrett's Esophagus and/or definite dysplastic changes at baseline were <BR>excluded from these studies. A total of 4092 patients were enrolled and ranged <BR>in age from 18 to 90 years (median age 48 years) with 54% male. Race was <BR>distributed as follows: 87% Caucasian, 5% Black and 8% other. Based on the Los <BR>Angeles Classification, 71% of patients had mild EE (Grades A and B) and 29% of <BR>patients had moderate to severe EE (Grades C and D) before treatment.<BR>                  The studies were designed to test non-inferiority. If non-inferiority was <BR>demonstrated then superiority would be tested. Although non-inferiority was <BR>demonstrated in both studies, the finding of superiority in one study was not <BR>replicated in the other.<BR>                  The proportion of patients with healed EE at week 4 or 8 is presented below <BR>in Table 5.<BR>                  <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="100%" ID="ia917aede-ecc1-45d4-866c-78882fb1d210"><BR>                     <caption>Table 5: EE Healing Rates*: All Grades</caption><BR>                     <tbody><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Study</content><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Number of Patients<br/>(N)<linkHtml href="#footnote-3">&#8224;</linkHtml><BR>                              </content><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Treatment Group<br/>(daily)</content><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Week 4<br/>% Healed</content><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">Week 8<linkHtml href="#footnote-4">&#8225;</linkHtml><BR>                                 <br/>% <BR>Healed</content><BR>                           </td><BR>                           <td><BR>                              <content styleCode="bold">(95% CI) for the Treatment <br/>Difference (KAPIDEX &#8211;
