Of the 353 patients, 50% of patients were female and 97% were Caucasian; 221 received KALYDECO and 132 received placebo from 16 to 48 weeks. Patients treated with KALYDECO were between the ages of 6 and 53 years. <BR>                        In these trials, the proportion of patients who prematurely discontinued study drug due to adverse reactions was 2% for KALYDECO-treated patients and 5% for placebo-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, which occurred more frequently in KALYDECO-treated patients included abdominal pain, increased hepatic enzymes, and hypoglycemia.<BR>                        Overall, the most common adverse reactions in 221 patients with CF who had either a G551D mutation or were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene and treated with KALYDECO were headache (17%), upper respiratory tract infection (16%), nasal congestion (16%), nausea (10%), rash (10%), rhinitis (6%), dizziness (5%), arthralgia (5%), and bacteria in sputum (5%). <BR>                        The incidence of adverse reactions below is based upon two double-blind, placebo-controlled 48-week clinical trials in a total of 213 patients with CF ages 6 to 53 who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene and who were treated with KALYDECO 150 mg orally or placebo twice daily. Table 1 shows adverse reactions occurring in ≥8% of KALYDECO-treated patients with CF who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene that also occurred at a higher rate than in the placebo-treated patients in the two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="75%"
