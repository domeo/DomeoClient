There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies of NEXIUM use in pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. <BR>                        Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of omeprazole. In four population-based cohort studies that included 1226 women exposed during the first trimester of pregnancy to omeprazole there was no increased risk of congenital anomalies. <BR>                         Reproductive studies with esomeprazole have been performed in rats at doses up to 57 times the human dose and in rabbits at doses up to 35 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. [ See Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (13.2)].<BR>                        Reproductive studies conducted with omeprazole on rats at oral doses up to 56 times the human dose and in rabbits at doses up to 56 times the human dose did not show any evidence of teratogenicity. In pregnant rabbits, omeprazole at doses about 5.5 to 56 times the human dose produced dose-related increases in embryo-lethality, fetal resorptions, and pregnancy loss. In rats treated with omeprazole at doses about 5.6 to 56 times the human dose, dose-related embryo/fetal toxicity and postnatal developmental toxicity occurred in offspring.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        Omeprazole concentrations have been measured in breast milk of one woman taking omeprazole 20 mg per day. However, the excretion of esomeprazole in milk has not been studied. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for NEXIUM in rat carcinogenicity studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4 Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        The safety and effectiveness of NEXIUM have been established in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age for short-term treatment (up to eight weeks) of GERD. However, effectiveness has not been demonstrated in patients less than 1 year of age.<BR>                        <BR>                           1 to 17 years of age <BR>                        <BR>                        Use of NEXIUM in pediatric and adolescent patients 1 to 17 years of age for short-term treatment (up to eight weeks) of GERD is supported by: a) extrapolation of results, already included in the currently approved labeling, from adequate and well-controlled studies that supported the approval of NEXIUM for adults, and b) safety and pharmacokinetic studies performed in pediatric and adolescent patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies, (14.3)<BR>                           ]. The safety and effectiveness of NEXIUM for other pediatric uses have not been established. <BR>                        <BR>                           Neonates to less than one year of age<BR>                        <BR>                        There was no statistically significant difference between NEXIUM and placebo in the rate of discontinuation in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled, treatment-withdrawal study of patients ages 1 to 11 months, inclusive. Patients were enrolled if they had either a clinical diagnosis of suspected GERD, symptomatic GERD, or endoscopically proven GERD. All patients received NEXIUM Delayed-Release Oral Suspension once daily during a two-week, open-label phase of the study. There were 80 patients who attained a pre-specified level of symptom improvement and who entered the double-blind phase, in which they were randomized in equal proportions to receive NEXIUM or placebo for the next four weeks. Efficacy was assessed by observing the time from randomization to study discontinuation due to symptom worsening during the four-week, treatment-withdrawal phase.<BR>                        The following pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information was obtained in pediatric patients with GERD aged birth to less than one year of age. In neonates (< 1 month old) given NEXIUM 0.5 mg/kg once daily, the percent time with intragastric pH > 4 over the 24-hour dosing period increased from 44% at baseline to 83% on Day 7. In infants (1 to 11 months old, inclusive) given NEXIUM 1.0 mg/kg once daily, the percent time with intragastric pH > 4 increased from 29% at baseline to 69% on Day 7, which is similar to the pharmacodynamic effect in adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Apparent clearance (CL/F) increases with age in pediatric patients from birth to 2 years of age.<BR>                        Because NEXIUM was not shown to be effective in the randomized, placebo-controlled study for this age group, the use of NEXIUM in patients less than 1 year of age is not indicated.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5 Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Of the total number of patients who received NEXIUM in clinical trials, 1459 were 65 to 74 years of age and 354 patients were ≥ 75 years of age.<BR>                        No overall differences in safety and efficacy were observed between the elderly and younger individuals, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
