Treatment with an MAOI should not be initiated within 2 weeks after discontinuing atomoxetine hydrochloride. With other drugs that affect brain monoamine concentrations, there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal reactions (including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) when taken in combination with an MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Such reactions may occur when these drugs are given concurrently or in close proximity [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     4.3 Narrow Angle Glaucoma<BR>                     <BR>                        In clinical trials, atomoxetine hydrochloride use was associated with an increased risk of mydriasis and therefore its use is not recommended in patients with narrow angle glaucoma.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
