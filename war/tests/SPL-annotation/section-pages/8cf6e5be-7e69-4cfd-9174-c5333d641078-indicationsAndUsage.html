The antidepressant action of citalopram tablets USP in hospitalized depressed patients has not been adequately studied.<BR>                  The efficacy of citalopram tablets USP in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 24 weeks following 6 to 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in two placebo-controlled trials (see <BR>                        CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY <BR>                     ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use citalopram tablets USP for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
