For heavily pretreated patients an initial dose of 50 mg/m2 per cycle repeated every 4 weeks is recommended.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     All Patients<BR>                     <BR>                        Pretreatment hydration with 1 to 2 liters of fluid infused for 8 to 12 hours prior to a PLATINOL dose is recommended. The drug is then diluted in 2 liters of 5% Dextrose in 1/2 or 1/3 normal saline containing 37.5 g of mannitol, and infused over a 6- to 8-hour period. If diluted solution is not to be used within 6 hours, protect solution from light. Adequate hydration and urinary output must be maintained during the following 24 hours.<BR>                        A repeat course of PLATINOL should not be given until the serum creatinine is below 1.5 mg/100 mL, and/or the BUN is below 25 mg/100 mL. A repeat course should not be given until circulating blood elements are at an acceptable level (platelets ≥100,000/mm3, WBC ≥4000/mm3). Subsequent doses of PLATINOL should not be given until an audiometric analysis indicates that auditory acuity is within normal limits.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     PREPARATION OF INTRAVENOUS SOLUTIONS<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Preparation Precautions<BR>                           <BR>                              Caution should be exercised in handling the powder and preparing the solution of cisplatin. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be utilized. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.1-4 To minimize the risk of dermal exposure, always wear impervious gloves when handling vials and IV sets containing PLATINOL for injection.<BR>                              Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to cisplatin may occur. The use of gloves is recommended. If PLATINOL powder or PLATINOL solution contacts the skin or mucosa, immediately and thoroughly wash the skin with soap and water and flush the mucosa with water.
