No metabolic-based drug interactions are therefore anticipated with these agents in patients.<BR>                  In preclinical in vivo studies, rasburicase did not affect the activity of isoenzymes CYP1A, CYP2A, CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2E, and CYP3A, suggesting no induction or inhibition potential. Clinically relevant P450-mediated drug-drug interactions are therefore not anticipated in patients treated with the recommended Elitek dose and dosing schedule.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
