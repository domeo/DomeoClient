Treatment of pregnant cynomolgus monkeys with pertuzumab resulted in oligohydramnios, delayed fetal kidney development, and embryo-fetal death.  If PERJETA is administered during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].<BR>                        Verify pregnancy status prior to the initiation of PERJETA.  Advise patients of the risks of embryo-fetal death and birth defects and the need for contraception during and after treatment.  Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they suspect they may be pregnant.  If PERJETA is administered during pregnancy or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving PERJETA, immediately report exposure to the Genentech Adverse Event Line at 1-888-835-2555.  Encourage women who may be exposed during pregnancy to enroll in the MotHER Pregnancy Registry by contacting 1-800-690-6720 [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].<BR>                        <BR>                        Monitor patients who become pregnant during PERJETA therapy for oligohydramnios.  If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care.  The efficacy of intravenous hydration in the management of oligohydramnios due to PERJETA exposure is not known.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.2	Left Ventricular Dysfunction<BR>                     <BR>                        Decreases in LVEF have been reported with drugs that block HER2 activity, including PERJETA.  In the randomized trial, PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel was not associated with increases in the incidence of symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) or decreases in LVEF compared with placebo in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].  Left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 4.4% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 8.3% of patients in the placebo-treated group.  Symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (congestive heart failure) occurred in 1.0% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 1.8% of patients in the placebo-treated group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].  Patients who have received prior anthracyclines or prior radiotherapy to the chest area may be at higher risk of decreased LVEF.<BR>                        PERJETA has not been studied in patients with a pretreatment LVEF value of ≤ 50%, a prior history of CHF, decreases in LVEF to < 50% during prior trastuzumab therapy, or conditions that could impair left ventricular function such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment or a cumulative prior anthracycline exposure to > 360 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or its equivalent.<BR>                        Assess LVEF prior to initiation of PERJETA and at regular intervals (e.g., every three months) during treatment to ensure that LVEF is within the institution's normal limits.  If LVEF is < 40%, or is 40% to 45% with a 10% or greater absolute decrease below the pretreatment value, withhold PERJETA and trastuzumab and repeat LVEF assessment within approximately 3 weeks.  Discontinue PERJETA and trastuzumab if the LVEF has not improved or has declined further, unless the benefits for the individual patient outweigh the risks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.3	Infusion-Associated Reactions, Hypersensitivity Reactions/Anaphylaxis<BR>                     <BR>                        PERJETA has been associated with infusion and hypersensitivity reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].  An infusion reaction was defined in the randomized trial as any event described as hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, acute infusion reaction or cytokine release syndrome occurring during an infusion or on the same day as the infusion.  The initial dose of PERJETA was given the day before trastuzumab and docetaxel to allow for the examination of PERJETA-associated reactions.  On the first day, when only PERJETA was administered, the overall frequency of infusion reactions was 13.0% in the PERJETA-treated group and 9.8% in the placebo-treated group.  Less than 1% were grade 3 or 4.  The most common infusion reactions (≥ 1.0%) were pyrexia, chills, fatigue, headache, asthenia, hypersensitivity, and vomiting.<BR>                        During the second cycle when all drugs were administered on the same day, the most common infusion reactions in the PERJETA-treated group (≥ 1.0%) were fatigue, dysgeusia, hypersensitivity, myalgia, and vomiting.<BR>                        In the randomized trial, the overall frequency of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions was 10.8% in the PERJETA-treated group and 9.1% in the placebo-treated group.  The incidence of Grade 3 – 4 hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions was 2% in the PERJETA-treated group and 2.5% in the placebo-treated group according to National Cancer Institute – Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI - CTCAE) (version 3).  Overall, 4 patients in PERJETA-treated group and 2 patients in the placebo-treated group experienced anaphylaxis.<BR>                        Observe patients closely for 60 minutes after the first infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions of PERJETA.  If a significant infusion-associated reaction occurs, slow or interrupt the infusion and administer appropriate medical therapies.  Monitor patients carefully until complete resolution of signs and symptoms.  Consider permanent discontinuation in patients with severe infusion reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.4	HER2 Testing<BR>                     <BR>                        Detection of HER2 protein overexpression is necessary for selection of patients appropriate for PERJETA therapy because these are the only patients studied and for whom benefit has been shown [see Indications and Usage (1) and Clinical Studies (14)].  In the randomized trial, patients with breast cancer were required to have evidence of HER2 overexpression defined as 3+ IHC by Dako Herceptest™ or FISH amplification ratio ≥ 2.0 by Dako HER2 FISH PharmDx™ test kit.  Only limited data were available for patients whose breast cancer was positive by FISH but did not demonstrate protein overexpression by IHC.<BR>                        Assessment of HER2 status should be performed by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency in the specific technology being utilized.  Improper assay performance, including use of sub-optimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
