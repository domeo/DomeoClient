Chemically, it is 3-(and is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Crystalline warfarin sodium is an isopropanol clathrate. The crystallization of warfarin sodium virtually eliminates trace impurities present in amorphous warfarin. Its molecular formula is C19H15NaO4, and its structural formula may be represented by the following:<BR><BR>                  <BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR>Crystalline warfarin sodium occurs as a white crystalline powder, odorless or practically odorless.<BR>Each warfarin sodium tablet intended for oral administration contains warfarin sodium clathrates equivalent to 1 mg or 2 mg or 2.5 mg or 3 mg or 4 mg or 5 mg or 6 mg or 7.5 mg or 10 mg of warfarin sodium. In addition each tablet contains the inactive ingredients hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate and pregelatinized starch. Additionally each 1 mg tablet contains D&C red no. 6 barium lake, 2 mg tablet contains FD&C blue no. 2 aluminum lake and FD&C red no. 40 aluminum lake, 2.5 mg tablet contains D&C yellow no. 10 aluminum lake and FD&C blue no. 1 aluminum lake, 3 mg tablet contains FD&C yellow no. 6 aluminum lake, FD&C blue no. 2 aluminum lake and FD&C red no. 40 aluminum lake, 4 mg tablet contains FD&C blue no. 1 aluminum lake, 5 mg tablet contains FD&C yellow no. 6 aluminum lake, 6 mg tablet contains FD&C yellow no. 6 aluminum lake and FD&C blue no. 1 aluminum lake, 7.5 mg tablet contains D&C yellow no. 10 aluminum lake and FD&C yellow no.6 aluminum lake and 10 mg tablet is dye free.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     MM1<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
