The risk<BR>              of developing hepatitis is age related. Approximate case rates by age are: 0 per<BR>              1,000 for persons under 20 years of age, 3 per 1,000 for persons in the 20 to 34<BR>              year age group, 12 per 1,000 for persons in the 35 to 49 year age group, 23 per<BR>              1,000 for persons in the 50 to 64 year age group, and 8 per 1,000 for persons<BR>              over 65 years of age. The risk of hepatitis is increased with daily consumption<BR>              of alcohol. Precise data to provide a fatality rate for isoniazid-related<BR>              hepatitis is not available; however, in a U.S. Public Health Service<BR>              Surveillance Study of 13,838 persons taking isoniazid, there were 8 deaths among<BR>              174 cases of hepatitis.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Therefore, patients given isoniazid should be carefully monitored and<BR>              interviewed at monthly intervals. Serum transaminase concentration becomes<BR>              elevated in about 10 percent to 20 percent of patients, usually during the first few months of<BR>              therapy, but it can occur at any time. Usually enzyme levels return to normal<BR>              despite continuance of drug, but in some cases progressive liver dysfunction<BR>              occurs. Patients should be instructed to report immediately any of the prodromal<BR>              symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, weakness, malaise, anorexia, nausea, or<BR>              vomiting. If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of hepatic damage are<BR>              detected, isoniazid should be discontinued promptly since continued use of the<BR>              drug in these cases has been reported to cause a more severe form of liver<BR>              damage.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Patients with tuberculosis should be given appropriate treatment with<BR>              alternative drugs. If isoniazid must be reinstituted, it should be reinstituted<BR>              only after symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared. The drug should<BR>              be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be<BR>              withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent liver involvement.<BR>              Treatment should be deferred in persons with acute hepatic diseases.<BR>            <BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
