This target dosage range is achieved by daily dosage adjustments, alerting patients to symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, starting at a dose of 1 mg twice daily, then moving to 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, and 12 mg twice daily on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively, to reach the 12 mg/day to 24 mg/day dose range. FANAPT can be administered without regard to meals.

The recommended starting dose for FANAPT tablets is 1 mg twice daily. Dose increases to reach the target range of 6-12 mg twice daily (12-24 mg/day) may be made with daily dosage adjustments not to exceed 2 mg twice daily (4 mg/day). The maximum recommended dose is 12 mg twice daily (24 mg/day). FANAPT doses above 24 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in the clinical trials. Efficacy was demonstrated with FANAPT in a dose range of 6 to 12 mg twice daily. Prescribers should be mindful of the fact that patients need to be titrated to an effective dose of FANAPT. Thus, control of symptoms may be delayed during the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment compared to some other antipsychotic drugs that do not require similar titration. Prescribers should also be aware that some adverse effects associated with FANAPT use are dose related.<BR>                        FANAPT can be administered without regard to meals.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.2     Dosage in Special Populations<BR>                     <BR>                        Dosage adjustments are not routinely indicated on the basis of age, gender, race, or renal impairment status [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Dosage adjustment for patients taking <BR>                           F<BR>                           ANAPT<BR>                            concomitantly with potential CYP2D6 inhibitors: FANAPT dose should be reduced by one-half when administered concomitantly with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine or paroxetine. When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, FANAPT dose should then be increased to where it was before [s<BR>                           ee Drug Interactions (7.1)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Dosage adjustment for patients taking <BR>                           F<BR>                           ANAPT<BR>                            concomitantly with potential CYP3A4 inhibitors: FANAPT dose should be reduced by one-half when administered concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or clarithromycin. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, FANAPT dose should be increased to where it was before [s<BR>                           ee Drug Interactions (7.1)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Dosage<BR>                            adjustment for patients taking FANAPT who are<BR>                            poor metabolizers of CYP2D6<BR>                           : FANAPT dose should be reduced by one-half for poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Hepatic Impairment:<BR>                            FANAPT is not recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.3     Maintenance Treatment<BR>                     <BR>                        Although there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with FANAPT should be maintained, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response.
