Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium tablets are synergism (impaired hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and altered physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium tablets are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. It is important to note that some drugs may interact by more than one mechanism.<BR>The following factors, alone or in combination, may be responsible for INCREASED PT/INR response:<BR>ENDOGENOUS

be unpredictable. More frequent PT/INR monitoring is therefore advisable. Medications of unknown interaction with coumarins are best regarded with caution. When these medications are started or stopped, more frequent PT/INR monitoring is advisable.<BR>It has been reported that concomitant administration of warfarin and ticlopidine may be associated with cholestatic hepatitis.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  <BR>              Botanical (Herbal) Medicines<BR><BR>                  Caution should be exercised when botanical medicines (botanicals) are taken concomitantly with warfarin sodium tablets. Few adequate, well-controlled studies exist evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium tablets. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation. It is good practice to monitor the patient's response with additional PT/INR determinations when initiating or discontinuing botanicals.<BR>Specific botanicals reported to affect warfarin sodium tablets therapy include the following:<BR><BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        ●     Bromelains, danshen, dong quai (Angelica sinensis), garlic, Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, and cranberry products are associated most often with an INCREASE in the effects of warfarin sodium tablets.<BR>              <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        ●     Coenzyme Q10 (ubidecarenone) and St. John's wort are associated most often with a DECREASE in the effects of warfarin sodium tablets.<BR>              <BR>                  Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g., garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium tablets. Conversely, other botanicals may have coagulant properties when taken alone or may decrease the effects of warfarin sodium tablets.<BR>Some botanicals that may affect coagulation are listed below for reference; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive.

Reported risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR >4.0), agehighly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, serious heart disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal insufficiency, concomitant drugs (seePRECAUTIONS) and long duration of warfarin therapy. Identification of risk factors for bleeding and certain genetic variations in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 in a patient may increase the need for more frequent INR monitoring and the use of lower warfarin doses (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:PharmacokineticsMetabolismandDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Bleeding is more likely to occur during the starting period and with a higher dose of warfarin sodium (resulting in a higher INR).<BR>Intramuscular (I.M.) injections of concomitant medications should be confined to the upper extremities which permits easy access for manual compression, inspections for bleeding and use of pressure bandages.<BR>Caution should be observed when warfarin sodium tablets are administered concomitantly with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to be certain that no change in anticoagulation dosage is required. In addition to specific drug interactions that might affect PT/INR, NSAIDs, including aspirin, can inhibit platelet aggregation, and can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulceration and/or perforation.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
