Strong CYPD6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxtine, fluoxetine, quinidine) markedly increase exposure to these metabolites. A reduction in XENAZINE dose may be necessary when adding a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine) in patients maintained on a stable dose of XENAZINE.  The daily dose of XENAZINE should not exceed 50 mg per day and the maximum single dose of XENAZINE should not exceed 25 mg in patient staking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors  [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.9), and <BR>                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.2   Reserpine<BR>                     <BR>                        Reserpine binds irreversibly to VMAT2 and the duration of its effect is several days.  Prescribers should wait for chorea to reemerge before administering XENAZINE to avoid overdosage and major depletion of serotonin and norepinephrine in the CNS. At least 20 days should elapse after stopping reserpine before starting XENAZINE. XENAZINE and reserpine should not be used concomitantly [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.12), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.3   Monoamine Oxidize Inhibitors (MAOIs)<BR>                     <BR>                        XENAZINE is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs. XENAZINE should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within a minimum of 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.12), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.4   Alcohol<BR>                     <BR>                        Concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs may have additive effects and worsen sedation and somnolence [<BR>                           see <BR>                           <BR>                              Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.5   Drugs that Cause QTc Prolongation<BR>                     <BR>                        Since XENAZINE causes a small increase in QTc prolongation (about 8 msec), the concomitant use with other drugs that are known to cause QTc prolongation should be avoided including antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, ziprasidone), antibiotics (e.g., moxifloxacin), Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide), and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications or any other medications known to prolong the QTc interval.  XENAZINE should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias.  Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Warnings and Precautions (5.11, <BR>                              5.12), Drug Interactions (7.7), <BR>                           and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.6   Neuroleptic Drugs<BR>                     <BR>                        Adverse reactions associated with XENAZINE, such as QTc prolongation, NMS, and extrapyramidal disorders, may be exaggerated by concomitant use of dopamine antagonists, including antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, thioridazine, ziprasidone)  [<BR>                           see <BR>                           <BR>                              Warnings and Precautions (5.5, <BR>                              5.10, <BR>                              5.11, <BR>                              5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.6)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
