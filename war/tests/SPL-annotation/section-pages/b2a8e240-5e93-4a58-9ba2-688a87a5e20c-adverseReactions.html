Renal toxicity has been noted in 28% to 36% of patients treated with a single dose of 50 mg/m2. It is first noted during the second week after a dose and is manifested by elevations in BUN and creatinine, serum uric acid and/or a decrease in creatinine clearance. Renal toxicity becomes more prolonged and severe with repeated courses of the drug. Renal function must return to normal before another dose of PLATINOL can be given. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to nephrotoxicity (see <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use<BR>                           ).<BR><BR>                        Impairment of renal function has been associated with renal tubular damage. The administration of PLATINOL using a 6- to 8-hour infusion with intravenous hydration, and mannitol has been used to reduce nephrotoxicity. However, renal toxicity still can occur after utilization of these procedures.<BR><BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Ototoxicity<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        Ototoxicity has been observed in up to 31% of patients treated with a single dose of PLATINOL 50 mg/m2, and is manifested by tinnitus and/or hearing loss in the high frequency range (4000 to 8000 Hz). The prevelance of hearing loss in children is particularly high and is estimated to be 40-60%. Decreased ability to hear normal conversational tones may occur. Deafness after the initial dose of PLATINOL has been reported. Ototoxic effects may be more severe in children receiving PLATINOL.<BR><BR>                        Hearing loss can be unilateral or bilateral and tends to become more frequent and severe with repeated cisplatin doses.  It is unclear whether PLATINOL-induced ototoxicity is reversible. Vestibular toxicity has also been reported. Ototoxic effects may be related to the peak plasma concentration of cisplatin.  Ototoxicity can occur during treatment or be delayed.  Audiometric monitoring should be performed prior to initiation of therapy, prior to each subsequent dose, and for several years post therapy.<BR><BR>                        The risk of ototoxicity may be increased by prior or simultaneous cranial irradiation, and may be more severe in patients less than 5 years of age, patients being treated with other ototoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycosides and vancomycin), and in patients with renal impairment.  Variants in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene (TPMT) have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of ototoxicity in children treated with cisplatin (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<BR>                           ).<BR><BR>                        Other genetic factors may also contribute to the cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.<BR><BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Hematologic<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        Myelosuppression occurs in 25% to 30% of patients treated with PLATINOL. The nadirs in circulating platelets and leukocytes occur between days 18 to 23 (range 7.5 to 45) with most patients recovering by day 39 (range 13 to 62). Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are more pronounced at higher doses (>50 mg/m2). Anemia (decrease of 2 g hemoglobin/100 mL) occurs at approximately the same frequency and with the same timing as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Fever and infection have also been reported in patients with neutropenia. Potential fatalities due to infection (secondary to myelosuppression) have been reported. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to myelosuppression (see <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use<BR>                           ).<BR><BR>                        In addition to anemia secondary to myelosuppression, a Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia has been reported. In the presence of cisplatin hemolytic anemia, a further course of treatment may be accompanied by increased hemolysis and this risk should be weighed by the treating physician.<BR><BR>                        The development of acute leukemia coincident with the use of PLATINOL has been reported. In these reports, PLATINOL was generally given in combination with other leukemogenic agents.<BR><BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Gastrointestinal<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        Marked nausea and vomiting occur in almost all patients treated with PLATINOL, and may be so severe that the drug must be discontinued. Nausea and vomiting may begin within 1 to 4 hours after treatment and last up to 24 hours. Various degrees of vomiting, nausea and/or anorexia may persist for up to 1 week after treatment.<BR><BR>                        Delayed nausea and vomiting (begins or persists 24 hours or more after chemotherapy) has occurred in patients attaining complete emetic control on the day of PLATINOL therapy.<BR><BR>                        Diarrhea has also been reported.<BR><BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
