Drug therapy is recommended as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with CHD or multiple risk factors for CHD, atorvastatin calcium tablets can be started simultaneously with diet.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        Atorvastatin calcium tablets are an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (statin) indicated as an adjunct therapy to diet to:<BR>                        <BR>                           Reduce the risk of MI, stroke, revascularization procedures, and angina in patients without CHD, but with multiple risk factors (1.1).<BR>                           Reduce the risk of MI and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes without CHD, but with multiple risk factors (1.1). <BR>                           Reduce the risk of non-fatal MI, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for CHF, and angina in patients with CHD (1.1). <BR>                           Reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG levels and increase HDL-C in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (1.2). <BR>                           Reduce elevated TG in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (1.2).<BR>                           Reduce total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) (1.2).<BR>                           Reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy (1.2).<BR>                                 <BR>Limitations of Use<BR>                              Atorvastatin calcium tablets have not been studied in Fredrickson Types I and V dyslipidemias.<BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     1.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease <BR>                     <BR>                        In adult patients without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as age, smoking, hypertension, low HDL-C, or a family history of early coronary heart disease, atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated to:<BR>                        <BR>                           Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction<BR>                           Reduce the risk of stroke<BR>                           Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures and angina<BR>                        <BR>                        In patients with type 2 diabetes, and without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension, atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated to: <BR>                        <BR>                           Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction<BR>                           Reduce the risk of stroke <BR>                        <BR>                        In patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease, atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated to: <BR>                        <BR>                           Reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction<BR>                           Reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal stroke<BR>                           Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures<BR>                           Reduce the risk of hospitalization for CHF<BR>                           Reduce the risk of angina  <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     1.2 Hyperlipidemia  <BR>                     <BR>                        Atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated: <BR>                        <BR>                           As an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG levels and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb);
