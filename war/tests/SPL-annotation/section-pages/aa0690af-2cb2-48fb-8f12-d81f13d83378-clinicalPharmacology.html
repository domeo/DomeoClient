none of the sextuplets survived (each weighed less than 400 g), although each appeared grossly normal.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" frame="void" width="662"><BR>                           <caption> Table 1&#160;
