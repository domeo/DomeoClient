Both trials in treatment-experienced subjects were conducted in clinically advanced, 3-class antiretroviral‑experienced (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NRTI], non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI], protease inhibitor [PI], or enfuvirtide) adults with evidence of HIV‑1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy.  <BR>                  The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with SELZENTRY:<BR>                  <BR>                     Adult patients infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 should use SELZENTRY. <BR>                     Tropism testing must be conducted with a highly sensitive tropism assay that has demonstrated the ability to identify patients appropriate for use of SELZENTRY. Outgrowth of pre-existing low-level CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic HIV-1 not detected by tropism testing at screening has been associated with virologic failure on SELZENTRY [see Microbiology (12.4), Clinical Studies (14.3)].<BR>                     Use of SELZENTRY is not recommended in subjects with dual/mixed- or CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 as efficacy was not demonstrated in a Phase 2 trial of this patient group.<BR>                     The safety and efficacy of SELZENTRY have not been established in pediatric patients.<BR>                     In treatment-naive subjects, more subjects treated with SELZENTRY experienced virologic failure and developed lamivudine resistance compared with efavirenz [see Microbiology (12.4), Clinical Studies (14.3)].<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        SELZENTRY is a CCR5 co-receptor antagonist indicated for combination antiretroviral treatment of adults infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1.<BR>                        <BR>                           In treatment-naive subjects, more subjects treated with SELZENTRY experienced virologic failure and developed lamivudine resistance compared with efavirenz.
