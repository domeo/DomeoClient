At a dose of 6 mcg/kg/week once weekly, the geometric mean Cmax was 4.4 ng/mL (CV 51%) and the geometric mean AUC(tau) was 430 ng∙hr/mL (CV 35%) at week 8. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 51 hours (CV 18%). The mean accumulation from week 1 to week 8 was 1.7. After administration of 3 mcg/kg/week once weekly, the mean geometric Cmax was 2.5 ng/mL (CV 33%) and the geometric mean AUC(<BR>                           tau) was 228 ng∙hr/mL (CV 24%) at week 4. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 43 hours (CV 19%).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Renal Dysfunction:<BR>                              <BR>                              The disposition of peginterferon alfa-2b was studied in 26 subjects with varying degrees of renal function after administration of a single subcutaneous dose of peginterferon alfa-2b at 1 mcg/kg. Renal clearance accounts for approximately 30% of total peginterferon alfa-2b clearance. The AUClast increased by 1.3-, 1.7- and 1.9-fold in mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. The mean elimination half-life and maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) increased in subjects with renal impairment. The mean AUClast was similar in subjects with severe renal impairment on and not on hemodialysis, suggesting that no clinical meaningful amounts of peginterferon alfa-2b were removed during hemodialysis.<BR>                              After subcutaneous administration of 1 mcg/kg of peginterferon alfa-2b once weekly for four weeks in 21 subjects with varying degrees of renal function, AUCtau at week 4 increased 1.3-fold in moderate and 2.1-fold in severe renal impairment. The Cmax at week 4 increased 1.8-fold in severe renal impairment, but no difference was observed in moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].<BR>                              The effect of varying degrees of renal impairment on pharmacokinetics of peginterferon alfa-2b at 3 mcg/kg and 6 mcg/kg recommended for patients with melanoma has not been studied.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Drug Interactions:<BR>                              <BR>                              In a two-way crossover trial, 12 healthy subjects were administered probe drugs of metabolic enzymes: caffeine (CYP1A2), tolbutamide (CYP2C9), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), midazolam (CYP3A4), and dapsone (N-acetyltransferase, NAT), with or without a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of peginterferon alfa-2b at 1 mcg/kg. The results suggest that single doses of peginterferon alfa-2b do not affect activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and NAT enzymes.<BR>                              In 24 healthy subjects, the effect of subcutaneous doses of peginterferon alfa-2b at 1 mcg/kg/week for 4 weeks on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, tolbutamide, dextromethorphan and midazolam were studied. A measure of CYP2C9 activity increased to 125% (90% CI: 116% to 135%) of baseline, whereas a measure of CYP2D6 activity decreased to 51% (90% CI: 38% to 67%) of baseline when coadministered with peginterferon alfa-2b at week 4, indicating that peginterferon alfa-2b may affect the metabolism of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 drugs. A measure of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 activity did not show clinically meaningful changes.<BR>                              When patients are administered SYLATRON with medications metabolized by CYP2C9 or CYP2D6, the therapeutic effect of these drugs may be altered.<BR>                              The effects of peginterferon alfa-2b at the clinical doses for melanoma (3 mcg/kg/week and 6 mcg/kg/week) on the systemic exposure of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzymes have not been studied [see Drug Interactions (7)].<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
