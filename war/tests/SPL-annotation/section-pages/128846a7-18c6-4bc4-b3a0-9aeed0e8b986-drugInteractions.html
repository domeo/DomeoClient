Patients receiving azathioprine tablets and allopurinol concomitantly should have a dose reduction of azathioprine tablets, to approximately ⅓ to ¼ the usual dose. It is recommended that a further dose reduction or alternative therapies be considered for patients with low or absent TPMT activity receiving azathioprine tablets and allopurinol because both TPMT and XO inactivation pathways are affected (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests<BR>                           and <BR>                              ADVERSE REACTIONS<BR>                           sections).<BR>                        <BR>                           Use with Aminosalicylates<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           There is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (e.g., sulphasalazine, mesalazine, or olsalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme.
