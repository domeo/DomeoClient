Coadministration of fluoxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, including certain antidepressants (e.g.. TCAs), antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines and most atypicals), and antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and others) should be approached with caution.Therapy with medications that are predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that have a relatively narrow therapeutic index (see list below) should be initiated at the low end of the dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine concurrently or has taken it in the previous 5 weeks. Thus, his/her dosing requirements resemble those of poor metabolizers. If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need for decreased dose of the original medication should be considered. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index represent the greatest concern (e.g., flecainide, propafenone, vinblastine, and TCAs).  Due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued  (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).CONTRAINDICATIONS and <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4<BR>In an in vivo interaction study involving coadministration of fluoxetine with single doses of terfenadine (a CYP3A4 substrate), no increase in plasma terfenadine concentrations occurred with concomitant fluoxetine. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than fluoxetine or norfluoxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including astemizole, cisapride, and midazolam. These data indicate that fluoxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.in vivo interaction study involving coadministration of fluoxetine with single doses of terfenadine (a CYP3A4 substrate), no increase in plasma terfenadine concentrations occurred with concomitant fluoxetine.

Nonetheless, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of fluoxetine and such drugs is required. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status (see Accumulation and Slow Elimination under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).Accumulation and Slow Elimination under <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Anticonvulsants<BR>Patients on stable doses of phenytoin and carbamazepine have developed elevated plasma anticonvulsant concentrations and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity following initiation of concomitant fluoxetine treatment.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Antipsychotics<BR>Some clinical data suggests a possible pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic interaction between SSRIs and antipsychotics. Elevation of blood levels of haloperidol and clozapine has been observed in patients receiving concomitant fluoxetine. Clinical studies of pimozide with other antidepressants demonstrate an increase in drug interaction or QTc prolongation. While a specific study with pimozide and fluoxetine has not been conducted, the potential for drug interactions or QTc prolongation warrants restricting the concurrent use of pimozide and Fluoxetine. Concomitant use of fluoxetine and pimozide is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). For thioridazine, see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.c prolongation.

This influence may persist for 3 weeks or longer after fluoxetine is discontinued. Thus, the dose of TCA may need to be reduced and plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored temporarily when fluoxetine is coadministered or has been recently discontinued (see Accumulation and slow elimination under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, and Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 under Drug Interactions).Accumulation and slow elimination under <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Serotonergic drugs<BR>Based on the mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs including fluoxetine hydrochloride, and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when fluoxetine hydrochloride is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, tramadol, or St. John’s Wort  (see Serotonin Syndrome under WARNINGS). The concomitant use of fluoxetine hydrochloride with other SSRIs, SNRIs or tryptophan is not recommended (see Tryptophan).Serotonin Syndrome under <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Triptans<BR>There have been rare postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan.

Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein bound fluoxetine by other tightly-bound drugs  (see Accumulation and slow elimination under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).Accumulation and slow elimination under <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Drugs that interfere with hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin)<BR>Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin potentiated the risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when fluoxetine is initiated or discontinued.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)<BR>There are no clinical studies establishing the benefit of the combined use of ECT and fluoxetine.
