<HTML><HEAD><META http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8"></HEAD><BODY><DIV><P><BR><BR><BR>Information for Patients<BR>(See Patient Information.)(See Patient Information.)Patients and their families should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, mania, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient’s physician, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with nefazodone and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about “Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions” is available for nefazodone. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking nefazodone.Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk: Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk: Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down.

At present, there is no way to predict who is likely to develop liver failure. Ordinarily, patients with active liver disease should not be treated with nefazodone. Patients should be advised to be alert for signs of liver dysfunction (jaundice, anorexia, gastrointestinal complaints, malaise, etc.) and to report them to their doctor immediately if they occur.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Time to Response/Continuation<BR>As with all antidepressants, several weeks on treatment may be required to obtain the full antidepressant effect. Once improvement is noted, it is important for patients to continue drug treatment as directed by their physician.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Interference With Cognitive and Motor Performance<BR>Since any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that nefazodone therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Pregnancy<BR>Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Nursing<BR>Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breast-feeding an infant (see PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers).PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers).<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Concomitant Medication<BR>Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions. Significant caution is indicated if nefazodone is to be used in combination with XANAX ®1 (alprazolam), concomitant use with HALCION®1 (triazolam), should be avoided for most patients including the elderly, and concomitant use with SELDANE®2 (terfenadine), HISMANAL®3 (astemizole), PROPULSID®3 (cisapride), ORAP®4 (pimozide), or TEGRETOL®5 (carbamazepine), is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).®1 (alprazolam), concomitant use with HALCION<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Alcohol<BR>Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking nefazodone.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Allergic Reactions<BR>Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they develop a rash, hives, or a related allergic phenomenon.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Visual Disturbances<BR>There have been reports of visual disturbances associated with the use of nefazodone, including blurred vision, scotoma, and visual trails.
