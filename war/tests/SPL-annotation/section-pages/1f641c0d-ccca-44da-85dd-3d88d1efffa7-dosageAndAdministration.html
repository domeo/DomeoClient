SeeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYfor dosing information in patients with renal failure.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Tuberculosis<BR><BR>                  Adults: 10 mg/kg, in a single daily administration, not to exceed 600 mg/day, orally.<BR>Pediatric Patients: 10 to 20 mg/kg, not to exceed 600 mg/day, orally.<BR>It is recommended that oral rifampin capsule be administered once daily, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.<BR>Rifampin is indicated in the treatment of all forms of tuberculosis. A three-drug regimen consisting of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide is recommended in the initial phase of short-course therapy which is usually continued for 2 months. The Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, the American Thoracic Society, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that either streptomycin or ethambutol be added as a fourth drug in a regimen containing isoniazid (INH), rifampin and pyrazinamide for initial treatment of tuberculosis unless the likelihood of INH resistance is very low. The need for a fourth drug should be reassessed when the results of susceptibility testing are known. If community rates of INH resistance are currently less than 4%, an initial treatment regimen with less than four drugs may be considered.<BR>Following the initial phase, treatment should be continued with rifampin and isoniazid for at least 4 months. Treatment should be continued for longer if the patient is still sputum or culture positive, if resistant organisms are present, or if the patient is HIV positive.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Incompatibilities:<BR><BR>                  Physical incompatibility (precipitate) was observed with undiluted (5 mg/mL) and diluted (1 mg/mL in normal saline) diltiazem hydrochloride and rifampin (6 mg/mL in normal saline) during simulated Y-site administration.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Meningococcal Carriers<BR><BR>                  Adults: For adults, it is recommended that 600 mg rifampin be administered twice daily for two days.<BR>Pediatric Patients: Pediatric patients 1 month of age or older: 10 mg/kg (not to exceed 600 mg per dose) every 12 hours for two days.<BR>Pediatric patients under 1 month of age: 5 mg/kg every 12 hours for two days.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>                  Preparation of Extemporaneous Oral Suspension<BR><BR>                  For pediatric and adult patients in whom capsule swallowing is difficult or where lower doses are needed, a liquid suspension may be prepared as follows:<BR>Rifampin 1% w/v suspension (10 mg/mL) can be compounded using one of four syrups-Simple Syrup (Syrup NF), Simple Syrup (Humco Laboratories) Syrpalta Syrup (Emerson Laboratories) or Raspberry Syrup (Humco Laboratories).<BR>1. Empty the contents of four Rifampin 300 mg capsules or eight Rifampin 150 mg capsules onto a piece of weighing paper.<BR>2. If necessary, gently crush the capsule contents with a spatula to produce a fine powder.<BR>3. Transfer the rifampin powder blend to a 4-ounce amber glass or plastic (high density polyethylene [HDPE], polypropylene, or polycarbonate) prescription bottle.<BR>4. Rinse the paper and spatula with 20 mL of syrup, and add the rinse to the bottle. Shake vigorously.<BR>5. Add 100 mL of syrup to the bottle and shake vigorously.<BR>This compounding procedure results in a 1% w/v suspension containing 10 mg rifampin/mL. Stability studies indicate that the suspension is stable when stored at room temperature (253C) or in a refrigerator (2-8C) for four weeks. This extemporaneously prepared suspension must be shaken well prior to administration.<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
