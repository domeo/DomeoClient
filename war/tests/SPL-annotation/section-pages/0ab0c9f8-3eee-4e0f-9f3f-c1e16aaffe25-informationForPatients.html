Liver function tests will be performed prior to initiating KALYDECO, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter [see <BR>                              Warnings and Precautions (5.1)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.2 	Drug Interactions with CYP3A Inducers and Inhibitors<BR>                     <BR>                        Ask patients to tell you all the medications they are taking including any herbal supplements or vitamins. Co-administration of KALYDECO with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's Wort) is not recommended as they may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of KALYDECO. Reduction of the dose of KALYDECO to 150 mg twice-a-week is recommended when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole. Dose reduction to 150 mg once daily is recommended when co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole. Food containing grapefruit or Seville oranges should be avoided [see <BR>                              Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)<BR>                            and <BR>                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.3 	Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        Inquire and/or assess whether patients have liver impairment. Reduce the dose of KALYDECO in patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) to 150 mg once daily. KALYDECO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15); however, exposure is expected to be substantially higher than that observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. When benefits are expected to outweigh the risks, KALYDECO should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment at a dose of 150 mg given once daily or less frequently. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5-6) [see <BR>                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.4 	Take with Fat-containing Food<BR>                     <BR>                        Inform your patients that KALYDECO is best absorbed by the body when taken with fatty food. A typical CF diet will satisfy this requirement. Examples include eggs, butter, peanut butter, cheese pizza, etc.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
