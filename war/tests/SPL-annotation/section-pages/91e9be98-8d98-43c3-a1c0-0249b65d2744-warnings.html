Each of these individual drugs has been associated with liver<BR>              dysfunction.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>                  Rifampin<BR>              Rifampin has been shown to produce liver dysfunction. Fatalities<BR>              associated with jaundice have occurred in patients with liver disease and in<BR>              patients taking rifampin with other hepatotoxic agents. Because RIFATER contains<BR>              both rifampin and isoniazid, it should only be given with caution and under<BR>              strict medical supervision to patients with impaired liver function. In these<BR>              patients, careful monitoring of liver function, especially serum glutamic<BR>              pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)<BR>              should be carried out prior to therapy and then every 2 to 4 weeks during<BR>              therapy. If signs of hepatocellular damage occur, RIFATER should be<BR>              withdrawn.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              In some cases, hyperbilirubinemia resulting from competition between rifampin<BR>              and bilirubin for excretory pathways of the liver at the cell level can occur in<BR>              the early days of treatment. An isolated report showing a moderate rise in<BR>              bilirubin and/or transaminase level is not in itself an indication for<BR>              interrupting treatment; rather, the decision should be made after repeating the<BR>              tests, noting trends in the levels, and considering them in conjunction with the<BR>              patient's clinical condition.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Rifampin has enzyme-inducing properties, including induction of delta amino<BR>              levulinic acid synthetase. Isolated reports have associated porphyria<BR>              exacerbation with rifampin administration.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              SEE THE BOXED WARNING<BR><BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
