Patients should remain under the care of a physician when using ZIAGEN. Advise patients that the use of ZIAGEN has not been shown to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV-1 to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. Patients should be informed to take all HIV medications exactly as prescribed.<BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.2 FDA Approved Patient Labeling<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
