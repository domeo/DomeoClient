In one case report, a breast-fed infant received about 4-6% of the maternal daily dose through breast milk and experienced no adverse effects.  However, milk production was inadequate and the baby was supplemented with formula.  In lactation studies in mice, female pup survival and pup weight at weaning were decreased.  This information suggests that maternal use of Carisoprodol Tablets may lead to reduced or less effective infant feeding (due to sedation) and/or decreased milk production.  Caution should be exercised when Carisoprodol Tablets are administered to a nursing woman.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        8.4 Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol Tablets in pediatric patients less than 16 years of age have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        8.5 Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol Tablets in patients over 65 years old have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        8.6 Renal Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        The safety and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol Tablets in patients with renal impairment have not been evaluated.
