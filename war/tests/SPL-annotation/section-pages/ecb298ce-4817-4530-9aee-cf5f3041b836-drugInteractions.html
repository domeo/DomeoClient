There was a 52% decrease in Cmax and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see <BR>                                 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1)<BR>                              <BR>                           ]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction.
