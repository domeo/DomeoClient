Therefore, a dose adjustment may be required when maraviroc is coadministered with those drugs [see <BR>                              Dosage and Administration (2)<BR>                           ]. <BR>                        Concomitant use of maraviroc and St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum) or products containing St. John's wort is not recommended. Coadministration of maraviroc with St. John's wort is expected to substantially decrease maraviroc concentrations and may result in suboptimal levels of maraviroc and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to maraviroc.<BR>                        For additional drug interaction information see <BR>                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
