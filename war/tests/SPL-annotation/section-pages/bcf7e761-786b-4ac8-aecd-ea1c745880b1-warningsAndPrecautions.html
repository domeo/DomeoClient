Obtain pretreatment serum transaminases. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if liver injury develops. (5.1, 5.8)<BR>                            Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Taste disturbance can be severe, may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if taste disturbance occurs. (5.2)<BR>                            Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if smell disturbance occurs. (5.3)<BR>                            Depressive symptoms have been reported with terbinafine use.    Prescribers should be alert to development of depressive symptoms. (5.4)<BR>                            Severe neutropenia has been reported. If the neutrophil count is ≤ 1,000 cells/mm3, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (5.5)<BR>                            Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with oral terbinafine use. If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.

The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops.<BR>                        Terbinafine tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets, pre-existing liver disease should be assessed. Hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Patients prescribed terbinafine tablets should be warned to report immediately to their physician any symptoms of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine or pale stools. Patients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and the patient’s liver function should be immediately evaluated.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste <BR><BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell <BR><BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets.

In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 terbinafine-treated patients (1.7%) and 3/137 placebo-treated patients (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm3 on two or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than six weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of terbinafine, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is <1,000 cells/mm3, terbinafine should be discontinued and supportive management started.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        5.6 Skin Reactions <BR><BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        There have been postmarketing reports of serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis).
