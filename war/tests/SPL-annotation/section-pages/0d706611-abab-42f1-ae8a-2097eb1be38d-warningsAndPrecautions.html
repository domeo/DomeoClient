Premedicate with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), (2.4), and (2.8)]. Have medications for the treatment of allergic reactions available for immediate use during administration. Signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions may include fever, rigors or chills, sweating, hypotension, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and nausea during or within 48 hours of infusion. Immediately interrupt BEXXAR infusions for severe reactions and provide appropriate medical and supportive care measures. Permanently, discontinue the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in patients who develop serious allergic reactions.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.2 Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen experienced severe (NCI CTC grade 3-4) and prolonged neutropenia (63%), thrombocytopenia (53%), and anemia (29%) [<BR>                           see<BR>                            Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The time to nadir was 4 to 7 weeks and the duration of cytopenias was approximately 30 days. Due to the variable nature of the onset of cytopenias, monitor patients with weekly complete blood counts for up to 12 weeks.<BR>                        The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen should not be administered to patients with >25% lymphoma marrow involvement, platelet count <100,000 cells/mm3, or neutrophil count <1,500 cells/mm3.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.3 Radiation Exposure<BR>                     <BR>                        The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen contains Iodine-131. Follow institutional radiation safety practices and applicable federal guidelines to minimize radiation exposure during handling and after administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen. Advise patients of the risks of radiation exposure of household contacts, pregnant women, and small children and of the steps to be taken to reduce these risks. <BR>                        The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen should be administered only by physicians enrolled in the certification program for dose calculation and administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen.

The median time to development of MDS or leukemia was 31 months [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. <BR>                        Non-hematologic malignancies may occur with the use of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and were reported in 5% of patients enrolled in clinical trials or the expanded access program. In the absence of controlled studies, the relative risk of secondary malignancies in patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen cannot be determined [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.5 Hypothyroidism<BR>                     <BR>                        The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen can cause hypothyroidism [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Initiate thyroid-blocking medications at least 24 hours before administering the dosimetric dose and continue until 14 days after the therapeutic dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The risk of hypothyroidism is likely to be increased in patients who do not complete the recommended thyroid-protective regimen. Evaluate for clinical evidence of hypothyroidism and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level before treatment and annually thereafter.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.6 Embryo-fetal Toxicity<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman including severe, and possibly irreversible, neonatal hypothyroidism. Inform patients who are pregnant or become pregnant after the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen about the potential hazard to a fetus. Evaluate infants born to mothers treated with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen during pregnancy for hypothyroidism at time of delivery and during the neonatal period [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. <BR>                        <BR>                        Males and females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and for 12 months after the therapeutic dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.7 Excessive Radiation Exposure in Patients With Impaired Renal Function<BR>                     <BR>                        There are no data regarding the safety of administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in patients with impaired renal function. Since the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen is primarily cleared through the kidneys, the rate of excretion of radiolabeled iodine is expected to be decreased in patients with impaired renal function or obstructive uropathy, which may result in increased patient exposure to I-131 tositumomab.
