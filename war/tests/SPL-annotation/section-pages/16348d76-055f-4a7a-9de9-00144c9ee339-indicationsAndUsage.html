A major depressive episode implies a prominent and relatively persistent depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks); it should include at least 4 of the following 8 symptoms: Change in appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. <BR>                        The effects of paroxetine tablets, USP in hospitalized depressed patients have not been adequately studied.<BR>                        The efficacy of paroxetine tablets, USP in maintaining a response in major depressive disorder for up to 1 year was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY —Clinical Trials).

In this trial, patients assigned to paroxetine showed a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY — Clinical Trials).

Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks.<BR>                        The efficacy of paroxetine tablets, USP were established in three 10- to 12-week trials in panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IIIR category of panic disorder (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY —Clinical Trials).<BR>                        <BR>                        Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which 4 (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes.<BR>                        Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 3-month relapse prevention trial.

Social anxiety disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of 1 or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. Exposure to the feared situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which may approach the intensity of a panic attack. The feared situations are avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is marked distress about having the phobias. Lesser degrees of performance anxiety or shyness generally do not require psychopharmacological treatment.<BR>                        The efficacy of paroxetine tablets, USP were established in three 12-week trials in adult patients with social anxiety disorder (DSM-IV). Paroxetine tablets, USP have not been studied in children or adolescents with social phobia (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY — Clinical Trials).<BR>                        <BR>                        The effectiveness of paroxetine tablets, USP in long-term treatment of social anxiety disorder, i.e., for more than 12 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in adequate and well-controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to prescribe paroxetine tablets, USP for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see <BR>                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     Generalized Anxiety Disorder:<BR>                     <BR>                        Paroxetine tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), as defined in DSM-IV.

It must be associated with at least 3 of the following 6 symptoms: Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance.<BR>                        The efficacy of paroxetine tablets, USP in maintaining a response in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, who responded during an 8-week acute treatment phase while taking paroxetine tablets, USP and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 24 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebocontrolled trial (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY —Clinical Trials).
