As with more typical antipsychotic drugs, CLOZARIL is contraindicated in severe central nervous system depression or comatose states from any cause.<BR>                  CLOZARIL should not be used simultaneously with other agents having a well-known potential to cause agranulocytosis or otherwise suppress bone marrow function. The mechanism of CLOZARIL-induced agranulocytosis is unknown; nonetheless, it is possible that causative factors may interact synergistically to increase the risk and/or severity of bone marrow suppression.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
