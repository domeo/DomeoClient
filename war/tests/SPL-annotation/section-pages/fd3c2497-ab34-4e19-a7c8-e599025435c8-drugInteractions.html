KAPIDEX is likely to substantially decrease the systemic concentrations of the HIV protease inhibitor atazanavir, which is dependent upon the presence of gastric acid for absorption, and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect of atazanavir and the development of HIV resistance. Therefore, KAPIDEX should not be co-administered with atazanavir.  <BR>                        It is theoretically possible that KAPIDEX may interfere with the absorption of other drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of oral bioavailability (e.g., ampicillin esters, digoxin, iron salts, ketoconazole).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.2	Warfarin<BR>                     <BR>                        Co-administration of KAPIDEX 90 mg and warfarin 25 mg did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin or INR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].  However, there have been reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs and warfarin concomitantly.  Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death.  Patients treated with KAPIDEX and warfarin concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.3   Tacrolimus<BR>                     <BR>                        Concomitant administration of dexlansoprazole and tacrolimus may increase whole blood levels of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
