Folic acid <BR>antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic <BR>reactions. <BR>                  A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone <BR>daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone <BR>levels averaged 2.1 ± 1.0 μg/mL in comparison to 1.5 ± 0.5 μg/mL for Dapsone <BR>alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 ± 5.2 μg/mL in comparison to <BR>12.4 ± 4.5 μg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual <BR>interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of <BR>the other about 1.5 times. <BR>                  A crossover study1 designed to assess the potential of <BR>a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 <BR>hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 <BR>cells/mm3) demonstrated that there was not a significant <BR>drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier <BR>report2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients <BR>with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving <BR>Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated <BR>that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels <BR>were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis: Dapsone has <BR>been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing <BR>mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female <BR>rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100. <BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
