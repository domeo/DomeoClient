When discontinuing chronically administered <BR>                     metoprolol succinate e<BR>                     xtended-release, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of 1 - 2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, metoprolol succinate extended-release administration should be reinstated promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Warn patients against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician’s advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue metoprolol succinate extended-release therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension (5.1).<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           WARNING: ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              (See Full Prescribing Information for complete boxed warning)<BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction have occurred.
