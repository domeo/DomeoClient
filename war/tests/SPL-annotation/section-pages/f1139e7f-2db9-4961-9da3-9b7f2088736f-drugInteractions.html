In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg of ZIAGEN twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.4 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
