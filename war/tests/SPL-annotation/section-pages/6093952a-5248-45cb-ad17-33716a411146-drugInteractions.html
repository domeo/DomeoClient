Should treatment with any of these agents be required, it is recommended that therapy with Tasigna be interrupted. If interruption of treatment with Tasigna is not possible, patients who require treatment with a drug that prolongs QT or strongly inhibits CYP3A4 should be closely monitored for prolongation of the QT interval [<BR>                           s<BR>                           ee<BR>                            <BR>                           Boxed Warning, <BR>                           Dos<BR>                           age and Administration<BR>                            (2<BR>                           .2<BR>                           ),<BR>                            Drug Interactions<BR>                            (7.<BR>                           2<BR>                           )]<BR>                           .<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               </P></DIV></HTML>
