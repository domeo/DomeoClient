Patients were within six months of diagnosis and were previously untreated for CML-CP, except for hydroxyurea and/or anagrelide. Efficacy was based on a total of 846 patients: 283 patients in the imatinib 400 mg once daily group, 282 patients in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily group, 281 patients in the nilotinib 400 mg twice daily group.<BR>                        Median age was 46 years in the imatinib group and 47 years in both nilotinib groups, with 12%, 13% and 10% of patients ≥65 years of age in imatinib 400 mg once daily, nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and nilotinib 400 mg twice daily treatment groups, respectively. There were slightly more male than female patients in all groups (56%, 56% and 62% in imatinib 400 mg once daily, nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and nilotinib 400 mg twice daily treatment groups, respectively). More than 60% of all patients were Caucasian, and 25% were Asian.<BR>                        The primary data analysis was performed when all 846 patients completed 12 months of treatment (or discontinued earlier). Subsequent analyses were done when patients completed 24 and 36 months of treatment (or discontinued earlier). The median time on treatment was approximately 36 months in all three treatment groups. This study is on-going and further data will be required to determine long-term outcome.<BR>                        The primary efficacy endpoint was major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months after the start of study medication. MMR was defined as ≤0.1% BCR-ABL/ABL % by international scale measured by RQ-PCR, which corresponds to a ≥3 log reduction of BCR-ABL transcript from standardized baseline. Efficacy endpoints are summarized in Table 9 below.<BR>                        Two patients in the nilotinib arm progressed to either accelerated phase or blast crisis (both within the first 6 months of treatment) while 17 patients on the imatinib arm progressed to either accelerated phase or blast crisis (8 patients within first 6 months, 4 within 6-12 months, 4 within 12-18 months and 1 within 18-24 months). Between the 24 and 36 month analyses, there were no new progressions to AP/BC in either treatment arm.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><BR>                           <caption>Table 9: Efficacy (MMR and CCyR) of TASIGNA Compared to Imatinib in Newly Diagnosed Ph+&#160;CML-CP</caption><BR>                           <col width="312"/><BR>                           <col width="144"/><BR>                           <col width="152"/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule "/><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">TASIGNA</content><BR>                                    <br/><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">300 mg</content><BR>                                    <br/><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">twice</content><BR>                                    <br/><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">daily</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Imatinib</content><BR>                                    <br/><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">400 mg</content><BR>                                    <br/><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">once</content><BR>                                    <br/><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">daily</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule "/><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">N = 282</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">N = 283</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule ">MMR at 12 months (95% CI)</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">44% (38.4, 50.3)</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">22% (17.6, 27.6)</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule ">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;P-Value<sup>a</sup>&#160;</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " colspan="2" align="center">&lt;0.0001</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule ">CCyR<sup>b</sup> by 12 months (95% CI)</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">80% (75.0, 84.6)</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">65% (59.2, 70.6)</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule ">MMR at&#160;24 months (95% CI)</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">62% (55.8,67.4)</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">38% (31.8,43.4)</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule ">CCyR<sup>b</sup> by 24 months (95% CI)</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">87% (82.4,90.6)</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Toprule Lrule Rrule " align="center">77% (71.7, 81.8)</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR><BR>                           a  CMH test stratified by Sokal risk group<BR>                        <BR>                           b CCyR: 0% Ph+ metaphases.

The definition of imatinib resistance included failure to achieve a complete hematologic response (by 3 months), cytogenetic response (by 6 months) or major cytogenetic response (by 12 months) or progression of disease after a previous cytogenetic or hematologic response. Imatinib intolerance was defined as discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity and lack of a major cytogenetic response at time of study entry. At the time of data cut-off, 321 patients with CML-CP and 137 patients with CML-AP with a minimum follow-up of 24 months were enrolled. In this study, about 50% of CML-CP and CML-AP patients were males, over 90% (CML-CP) and 80% (CML-AP) were Caucasian, and approximately 30% were age 65 years or older.<BR>                        <BR>                        Overall, 73% of patients were imatinib resistant while 27% were imatinib intolerant. The median time of prior imatinib treatment was approximately 32 (CML-CP) and 28 (CML-AP) months. Prior therapy included hydroxyurea in 85% of patients, interferon in 56% and stem cell or bone marrow transplant in 8%. The median highest prior imatinib dose was 600 mg/day for patients with CML-CP and CML-AP, and the highest prior imatinib dose was ≥600 mg/day in 74% of all patients with 40% of patients receiving imatinib doses ≥800 mg/day.<BR>                        <BR>                        Median duration of nilotinib treatment was 18.4 months in patients with CML-CP and 8.7 months in patients with CML-AP.<BR>                        <BR>                        The efficacy endpoint in CML-CP was unconfirmed major cytogenetic response (MCyR) which included complete and partial cytogenetic responses.<BR>                        <BR>                        The efficacy endpoint in CML-AP was confirmed hematologic response (HR), defined as either a complete hematologic response (CHR) or no evidence of leukemia (NEL).
