XELODA tablets should be swallowed with water within 30 minutes after a meal. In combination with docetaxel, the recommended dose of XELODA is 1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period, combined with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Pre-medication, according to the docetaxel labeling, should be started prior to docetaxel administration for patients receiving the XELODA plus docetaxel combination. <BR>                        Table 17<BR>                      displays the total daily dose by body surface area and the number of tablets to be taken at each dose.<BR>                  Adjuvant treatment in patients with Dukes' C colon cancer is recommended for a total of 6 months, ie, XELODA 1250 mg/m2 orally twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period, given as 3-week cycles for a total of 8 cycles (24 weeks).<BR>                  <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ID="t17" width="80%"><BR>                     <caption>Table 17	XELODA Dose Calculation According to Body Surface Area</caption><BR>                     <col align="center" width="25%" valign="middle"/><BR>                     <col align="center" width="25%" valign="middle"/><BR>                     <col align="center" width="25%" valign="middle"/><BR>                     <col align="center" width="25%" valign="middle"/><BR>                     <thead><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <th colspan="2" styleCode="Lrule">Dose Level 1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup><BR>                              <br/>Twice a Day</th><BR>                           <th colspan="2" styleCode="Lrule Rrule">Number of Tablets to be Taken at<br/>Each Dose (Morning and Evening)</th><BR>                        </tr><BR>                        <tr><BR>                           <th styleCode="Lrule Toprule">Surface Area<br/>(m<sup>2</sup>)</th><BR>                           <th styleCode="Lrule Toprule">Total Daily<br/>Dose<footnote>Total Daily Dose divided by 2 to allow equal morning and evening doses</footnote> (mg)</th><BR>                           <th styleCode="Lrule Toprule" valign="top">150 mg</th><BR>                           <th styleCode="Lrule Rrule Toprule" valign="top">500 mg</th><BR>                        </tr><BR>                     </thead><BR>                     <tbody><BR>                        <tr styleCode="Botrule"><BR>                           <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule">&#8804;
