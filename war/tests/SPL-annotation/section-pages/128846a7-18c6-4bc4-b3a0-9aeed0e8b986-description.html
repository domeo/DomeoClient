Each uncoated azathioprine tablet intended for oral administration contains 50 mg of azathioprine. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, povidone and starch.<BR>                  Azathioprine is chemically 6-[(1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazol-5-yl)thio]-1H-purine. The structural formula of azathioprine is: <BR>                  <BR>                  It is an imidazolyl derivative of 6-mercaptopurine and many of its biological effects are similar to those of the parent compound. <BR>                  Azathioprine is a pale yellow, odorless powder. It is insoluble in water, soluble in dilute solutions of alkali hydroxides, sparingly soluble in dilute mineral acids, very slightly soluble in alcohol and in chloroform. The sodium salt of azathioprine is sufficiently soluble to make a 10 mg/mL water solution which is stable for 24 hours at 59째 to 77째F (15째 to 25째C). Azathioprine is stable in solution at neutral or acid pH but hydrolysis to mercaptopurine occurs in excess sodium hydroxide (0.1N), especially on warming. Conversion to mercaptopurine also occurs in the presence of sulfhydryl compounds such as cysteine, glutathione, and hydrogen sulfide. <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     structure formula for Azathioprine<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
