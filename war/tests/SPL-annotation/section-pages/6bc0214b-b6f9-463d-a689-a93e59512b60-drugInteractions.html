While a specific <BR>study with pimozide and fluoxetine has not been conducted, the potential for <BR>drug interactions or QTc prolongation warrants <BR>restricting the concurrent use of pimozide and fluoxetine [see <BR>                                 Contraindications <BR>(4)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        ThioridazineThioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within <BR>a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued [see <BR>                                 Contraindications <BR>(4)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                        In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid <BR>hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced <BR>a 2.4-fold higher Cmax and a 4.5-fold higher AUC for <BR>thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared with the rapid hydroxylators. <BR>The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is felt to depend on the level of CYP2D6 <BR>isozyme activity. Thus, this study suggests that drugs which inhibit CYP2D6, <BR>such as certain SSRIs, including fluoxetine, will produce elevated plasma levels <BR>of thioridazine. <BR>                        Thioridazine administration produces a dose related prolongation of the <BR>QTc interval, which is associated with serious <BR>ventricular arrhythmias, such as Torsades de pointes type arrhythmias and sudden <BR>death. This risk is expected to increase with fluoxetine-induced inhibition of <BR>thioridazine metabolism. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6Fluoxetine inhibits the activity of CYP2D6, and may make <BR>individuals with normal CYP2D6 metabolic activity resemble a poor metabolizer. <BR>Coadministration of fluoxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, <BR>including certain antidepressants (e.g., TCAs), antipsychotics (e.g., <BR>phenothiazines and most atypicals) and antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, <BR>flecainide and others) should be approached with caution. Therapy with <BR>medications that are predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that <BR>have a relatively narrow therapeutic index (see list below) should be initiated <BR>at the low end of the dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine <BR>concurrently or has taken it in the previous 5 weeks. Thus, his/her dosing <BR>requirements resemble those of poor metabolizers. If fluoxetine is added to the <BR>treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, <BR>the need for decreased dose of the original medication should be considered. <BR>Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index represent the greatest concern (e.g., <BR>flecainide, propafenone, vinblastine and TCAs). Due to the risk of serious <BR>ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated <BR>plasma levels of thioridazine, thioridazine should not be administered with <BR>fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued <BR>[see <BR>                                 Contraindications <BR>(4)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)In two studies, previously stable plasma levels of imipramine and <BR>desipramine have increased greater than 2- to 10-fold when fluoxetine has been <BR>administered in combination.

Elevation of blood <BR>levels of haloperidol and clozapine has been observed in patients receiving <BR>concomitant fluoxetine [see <BR>                                 Contraindications <BR>(4)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        AnticonvulsantsPatients on stable doses of phenytoin and carbamazepine have <BR>developed elevated plasma anticonvulsant concentrations and clinical <BR>anticonvulsant toxicity following initiation of concomitant fluoxetine <BR>treatment.<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        LithiumThere have been reports of both increased and decreased lithium <BR>levels when lithium was used concomitantly with fluoxetine. Cases of lithium <BR>toxicity and increased serotonergic effects have been reported. Lithium levels <BR>should be monitored when these drugs are administered concomitantly. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Drugs Tightly Bound to Plasma ProteinsBecause fluoxetine is tightly bound to plasma protein, the <BR>administration of fluoxetine to a patient taking another drug that is tightly <BR>bound to protein (e.g., Coumadin®, digitoxin) may cause a <BR>shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse effect [see <BR>                                 C1inical <BR>Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4In an in vivo interaction study <BR>involving coadministration of fluoxetine with single doses of terfenadine (a <BR>CYP3A4 substrate), no increase in plasma terfenadine concentrations occurred <BR>with concomitant fluoxetine.<BR>                        Additionally, in vitro studies have shown <BR>ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times <BR>more potent than fluoxetine or norfluoxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism <BR>of several substrates for this enzyme, including astemizole, cisapride and <BR>midazolam. These data indicate that fluoxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 <BR>activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        OlanzapineFluoxetine (60 mg single dose or 60 mg daily dose for 8 days) <BR>causes a small (mean 16%) increase in the maximum concentration of olanzapine <BR>and a small (mean 16%) decrease in olanzapine clearance. The magnitude of the <BR>impact of this factor is small in comparison to the overall variability between <BR>individuals, and therefore dose modification is not routinely recommended. <BR>                        <BR>                           When using fluoxetine and olanzapine and in combination, <BR>also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for <BR>Symbyax®. <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
