This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves or their caregiver. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.<BR>                        <BR>                           Pregnancy Category C.<BR>                        <BR>                        There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ONFI in pregnant women and no adequate developmental toxicity studies of clobazam in animals.<BR>                        Although limited, the available animal data suggest developmental toxicity, including an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities following oral administration of clobazam to pregnant animals at doses similar to those used clinically.<BR>                        Data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of adverse effects in animals and humans. Long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function have been reported in rodents following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines. Neonatal flaccidity, respiratory and feeding difficulties, hypothermia, and withdrawal symptoms have been reported in infants born to mothers who received benzodiazepines, including clobazam, late in pregnancy.<BR>                        Therefore, ONFI should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        ONFI is excreted in human milk.

The effect on bone density, but not on behavior, was reversible when drug was discontinued. The no-effect level for juvenile toxicity (36 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) to clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, less than those expected at therapeutic doses in pediatric patients.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.5 Geriatric Use<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        Clinical studies of ONFI did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, elderly subjects appear to eliminate clobazam more slowly than younger subjects based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. For these reasons, the initial dose in elderly patients should be 5 mg/day. Patients should be titrated initially to 10-20 mg/day. Patients may be titrated further to a maximum daily dose of 40 mg if tolerated [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.6 CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        Concentrations of clobazam's active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, are higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers. For this reason, dosage modification is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.7 Renal Impairment<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        The pharmacokinetics of ONFI were evaluated in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There were no significant differences in systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) between patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There is essentially no experience with ONFI in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. It is not known if clobazam or its active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, is dialyzable [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>8.8 Hepatic Impairment<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        ONFI is hepatically metabolized; however, there are limited data to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ONFI. For this reason, dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-9). There is inadequate information about metabolism of ONFI in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
