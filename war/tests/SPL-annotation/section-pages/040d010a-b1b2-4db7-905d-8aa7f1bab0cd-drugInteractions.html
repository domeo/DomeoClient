Patients receiving azathioprine tablets and allopurinol concomitantly should have a dose reduction of azathioprine tablets, to approximately ⅓ to ¼ the usual dose. It is recommended that a further dose reduction or alternative therapies be considered for patients with low or absent TPMT activity receiving azathioprine tablets and allopurinol because both TPMT and XO inactivation pathways are affected (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, <BR>                           <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests<BR>                           and <BR>                              ADVERSE REACTIONS<BR>                           sections).<BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Use with <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              Aminosalicylates<BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                        There is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (e.g., sulphasalazine, mesalazine, or olsalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme.

Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMDH) is required for one of the metabolic pathways of azathioprine. Ribavirin is known to inhibit IMDH, thereby leading to accumulation of an azathioprine metabolite, 6-methylthioionosine monophosphate (6MTITP), which is associated with myelotoxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia). Patients receiving azathioprine with ribavirin should have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, monitored weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage or other therapy changes are necessary.<BR>                        <BR>                           Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility <BR>                        <BR>                        See WARNINGS section.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               </P></DIV></HTML>
