If hyperuricemia is accompanied by acute gouty arthritis, pyrazinamide should be discontinued.Pyrazinamide should be used with caution in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus, as management may be more difficult.Primary resistance of M. tuberculosis to pyrazinamide is uncommon.  In cases with known or suspected drug resistance, in vitro susceptibility tests with recent cultures of M. tuberculosis against pyrazinamide and the usual primary drugs should be performed.  There are few reliable in vitro tests for pyrazinamide resistance.  A reference laboratory capable of performing these studies must be employed.M. tuberculosis to pyrazinamide is uncommon.  In cases with known or suspected drug resistance, <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Information for Patients:<BR>Patients should be instructed to notify their physicians promptly if they experience any of the following:  fever, loss of appetite, malaise, nausea and vomiting, darkened urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, pain or swelling of the joints.Compliance with the full course of therapy must be emphasized, and the importance of not missing any doses must be stressed.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Laboratory Tests:<BR>Baseline liver function studies [especially ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT) determinations] and uric acid levels should be determined prior to therapy.  Appropriate laboratory testing should be performed at periodic intervals and if any clinical signs of symptoms occur during therapy.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:<BR>Pyrazinamide has been reported to interfere with ACETEST® and KETOSTIX® urine tests to produce a pink-brown color.5® and KETOSTIX<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:6,7,8<BR>In lifetime bioassays in rats and mice, pyrazinamide was administered in the diet at concentrations of up to 10,000 ppm.  This resulted in estimated daily doses for the mouse of 2 g/kg, or 40 times the maximum human dose, and for the rat of 0.5 g/kg, or 10 times the maximum human dose. Pyrazinamide was not carcinogenic in rats or male mice and no conclusion was possible for female mice due to insufficient numbers of surviving control mice.Pyrazinamide was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial test, but induced chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocyte cell cultures.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Pregnancy: <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Teratogenic Effects-Pregnancy Category C<BR>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with pyrazinamide.  It is also not known whether pyrazinamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Pyrazinamide should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Nursing Mothers:<BR>Pyrazinamide has been found in small amounts in breast milk.  Therefore, it is advised that pyrazinamide be used with caution in nursing mothers taking into account the risk-benefit of this therapy.99<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Usage in Children:<BR>Pyrazinamide regimens employed in adults are probably equally effective in children.4,10,11 Pyrazinamide appears to be well tolerated in children.4,10,11 Pyrazinamide appears to be well tolerated in children.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Geriatric Use:12<BR>Clinical studies of pyrazinamide did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.  Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or renal function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.It does not appear that patients with impaired renal function require a reduction in dose. It may be prudent to select doses at the low end of the dosing range, however.1313<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></P></DIV></HTML>
