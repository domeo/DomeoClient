The trial enrolled 675 patients; 337 were allocated to receive ZELBORAF 960 mg by mouth twice daily and 338 to receive dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1 every 3 weeks. Randomization was stratified according to disease stage, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ECOG performance status and geographic region. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, and/or consent withdrawal.  The major efficacy outcome measures of the trial were overall survival (OS) and investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Other outcome measures included confirmed investigator-assessed best overall response rate.<BR>                        Baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. Most patients were male (56%) and Caucasian (99%), the median age was 54 years (24% were ≥ 65 years), all patients had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and the majority of patients had metastatic disease (95%).<BR>                        Efficacy results are summarized in Table 4 and Figure 1.<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="100%" ID="table4"><BR>                           <caption>Table 4     Efficacy of ZELBORAF in Treatment Naive Patients with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> Mutation-Positive Melanoma<footnote>As detected by the cobas<sup>&#174;</sup> 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test</footnote><BR>                           </caption><BR>                           <col width="25%" align="left" valign="top"/><BR>                           <col width="25%" align="center" valign="top"/><BR>                           <col width="25%" align="center" valign="top"/><BR>                           <col width="25%" align="center" valign="bottom"/><BR>                           <thead><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Lrule Rrule"/><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Rrule">ZELBORAF<br/>(N=337)</th><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Rrule">Dacarbazine<br/>(N=338)</th><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Rrule" valign="top">p-value<footnote> Unstratified log-rank test</footnote><BR>                                 </th><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </thead><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr styleCode="Botrule"><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule" colspan="4"><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Overall Survival</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr styleCode="Botrule"><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule">&#160;&#160;Number of Deaths</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Rrule">78 (23%)</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Rrule">121 (36%)</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Rrule"/><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr styleCode="Botrule"><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule Rrule">&#160;&#160;Hazard Ratio<br/>&#160;&#160;(95% CI)<footnote ID="t4f1">Hazard ratio estimated using Cox model;
