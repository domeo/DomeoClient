Suicide is a known risk of <BR>depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders <BR>themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a <BR>long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing <BR>worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients <BR>during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term <BR>placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that <BR>these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in <BR>children, adolescents and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive <BR>disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show <BR>an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo <BR>in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to <BR>placebo in adults aged 65 and older. <BR>                        The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents <BR>with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or other psychiatric disorders <BR>included a total of 24 short-term trials of nine antidepressant drugs in over <BR>4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with <BR>MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials <BR>(median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 <BR>patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, <BR>but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs <BR>studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the <BR>different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences <BR>(drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across <BR>indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of <BR>cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 2. <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="0.000" ID="ie4b3b7c0-9964-4b4c-8a48-3459cdeeedd5"><BR>                           <caption>TABLE 2: Suicidality per 1,000 Patients Treated</caption><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <col/><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Age <BR>Range</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td><BR>                                    <content styleCode="bold">Drug-Placebo <BR>Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1,000 Patients <BR>Treated</content><BR>                                 </td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td><BR>                                    <br/><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td>Increases Compared to <BR>Placebo</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td>&lt; 18</td><BR>                                 <td>14 additional cases</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td>18 to 24</td><BR>                                 <td>5 additional cases</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td><BR>                                    <br/><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td>Decreases Compared to <BR>Placebo</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td>25 to 64</td><BR>                                 <td>1 fewer case</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td><BR>                                    <content styleCode="underline">&gt;</content> 65</td><BR>                                 <td>6 fewer <BR>cases</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in <BR>the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion <BR>about drug effect on suicide. <BR>                        It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., <BR>beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from <BR>placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of <BR>antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. <BR>                        <BR>                           All patients being treated with antidepressants for any <BR>indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical <BR>worsening, suicidality and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the <BR>initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, <BR>either increases or decreases. <BR>                        <BR>                        The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, <BR>irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor <BR>restlessness), hypomania and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric <BR>patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as <BR>well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a <BR>causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of <BR>depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, <BR>there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging <BR>suicidality. <BR>                        Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including <BR>possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is <BR>persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms <BR>that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if <BR>these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s <BR>presenting symptoms. <BR>                        If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be <BR>tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt <BR>discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see <BR>Warnings and <BR>Precautions (5.13)].<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           Families and caregivers of patients being treated with <BR>antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both <BR>psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor <BR>patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in <BR>behavior and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of <BR>suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. <BR>Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and <BR>caregivers. Prescriptions for fluoxetine should be written for the <BR>smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order <BR>to reduce the risk of overdose.<BR>                        It should be noted that fluoxetine is approved in the pediatric population <BR>only for major depressive disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Safety and <BR>effectiveness of fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination in patients less than <BR>18 years of age have not been established. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.2 Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-Like Reactions<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           The <BR>development of a potentially life threatening serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic <BR>malignant syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs <BR>alone, including fluoxetine treatment, but particularly with concomitant use of <BR>serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of <BR>serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine <BR>antagonists. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes <BR>(e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., <BR>tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations <BR>(e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., <BR>nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can <BR>resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle <BR>rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs <BR>and mental status changes.

Among the <BR>cases of rash and/or urticaria reported in premarketing clinical trials, almost <BR>a third were withdrawn from treatment because of the rash and/or systemic signs <BR>or symptoms associated with the rash. Clinical findings reported in association <BR>with rash include fever, leukocytosis, arthralgias, edema, carpal tunnel <BR>syndrome, respiratory distress, lymphadenopathy, proteinuria and mild <BR>transaminase elevation. Most patients improved promptly with discontinuation of <BR>fluoxetine and/or adjunctive treatment with antihistamines or steroids, and all <BR>patients experiencing these reactions were reported to recover completely. <BR>                        In premarketing clinical trials, two patients are known to have developed a <BR>serious cutaneous systemic illness. In neither patient was there an unequivocal <BR>diagnosis, but one was considered to have a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and the <BR>other, a severe desquamating syndrome that was considered variously to be a <BR>vasculitis or erythema multiforme. Other patients have had systemic syndromes <BR>suggestive of serum sickness. <BR>                        Since the introduction of fluoxetine, systemic reactions, possibly related to <BR>vasculitis and including lupus-like syndrome, have developed in patients with <BR>rash. Although these reactions are rare, they may be serious, involving the <BR>lung, kidney or liver. Death has been reported to occur in association with <BR>these systemic reactions. <BR>                        Anaphylactoid reactions, including bronchospasm, angioedema, laryngospasm and <BR>urticaria alone and in combination, have been reported. <BR>                        Pulmonary reactions, including inflammatory processes of varying <BR>histopathology and/or fibrosis, have been reported rarely. These reactions have <BR>occurred with dyspnea as the only preceding symptom. <BR>                        Whether these systemic reactions and rash have a common underlying cause or <BR>are due to different etiologies or pathogenic processes is not known. <BR>Furthermore, a specific underlying immunologic basis for these reactions has not <BR>been identified. Upon the appearance of rash or of other possibly allergic <BR>phenomena for which an alternative etiology cannot be identified, fluoxetine <BR>should be discontinued. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.4 Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder and Monitoring for Mania/Hypomania<BR>                     <BR>                        A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of <BR>bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled <BR>trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase <BR>the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for <BR>bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described for clinical worsening <BR>and suicide risk represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to <BR>initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms <BR>should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar <BR>disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, <BR>including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder and depression. It <BR>should be noted that fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination is approved for <BR>the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder <BR>[see Warnings and Precautions section of the package insert <BR>for Symbyax]. Fluoxetine monotherapy is not indicated for the treatment <BR>of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. <BR>                        In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for major depressive disorder, <BR>mania/hypomania was reported in 0.1% of patients treated with fluoxetine and <BR>0.1% of patients treated with placebo. Activation of mania/hypomania has also <BR>been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder <BR>treated with other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive <BR>disorder [see <BR>                                 Use in <BR>Specific Populations (8.4)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                        In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for OCD, mania/hypomania was <BR>reported in 0.8% of patients treated with fluoxetine and no patients treated <BR>with placebo. No patients reported mania/hypomania in U.S. placebo-controlled <BR>clinical trials for bulimia.

Concomitant use of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, <BR>warfarin and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and <BR>epidemiological studies (case control and cohort design) have demonstrated an <BR>association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the <BR>occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding reactions related to SNRIs and <BR>SSRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis and petechiae to <BR>life threatening hemorrhages. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of <BR>bleeding associated with the concomitant use of fluoxetine and NSAIDs, aspirin, <BR>warfarin or other drugs that affect coagulation [see <BR>                                 Drug Interactions <BR>(7.6)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.8 Hyponatremia<BR>                     <BR>                        Hyponatremia has been reported during treatment with SNRIs and <BR>SSRIs, including fluoxetine. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the <BR>result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). <BR>Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported and appeared to <BR>be reversible when fluoxetine was discontinued. Elderly patients may be at <BR>greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs and SSRIs. Also, patients <BR>taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk <BR>[see Use in <BR>Specific Populations (8.5)]. Discontinuation of fluoxetine should be <BR>considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical <BR>intervention should be instituted. <BR>                        Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty <BR>concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness and unsteadiness, which <BR>may lead to falls.

This is of potential consequence when drug <BR>discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact <BR>with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the discontinuation of fluoxetine <BR>[see <BR>                                 Clinical <BR>Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                              ].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.13 Discontinuation of Treatment<BR>                     <BR>                        During marketing of fluoxetine, SNRIs and SSRIs, there have been spontaneous <BR>reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, <BR>particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, <BR>agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric <BR>shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, <BR>insomnia and hypomania. While these reactions are generally self limiting, there <BR>have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be <BR>monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with fluoxetine. A <BR>gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended <BR>whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the <BR>dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously <BR>prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue <BR>decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Plasma fluoxetine and <BR>norfluoxetine concentration decrease gradually at the conclusion of therapy <BR>which may minimize the risk of discontinuation symptoms with this drug. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.14 Fluoxetine and Olanzapine in Combination<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           When using fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination, also <BR>refer to the Warnings and Precautions section of the package insert for <BR>Symbyax®. <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
