The mechanism of action of flurbiprofen, like that of other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Absorption<BR>                           <BR>                              The mean oral bioavailability of flurbiprofen from flurbiprofen tablets 100 mg is 96% relative to an oral solution. Flurbiprofen is rapidly and non-stereoselectively absorbed from flurbiprofen tablets, with peak plasma concentrations occurring at about 2 hours (see Table 1). Administration of flurbiprofen tablets with either food or antacids may alter the rate but not the extent of flurbiprofen absorption. Ranitidine has been shown to have no effect on either the rate or extent of flurbiprofen absorption from flurbiprofen tablets.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Distribution<BR>                           <BR>                              The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of both R- and S-flurbiprofen is approximately 0.12 L/kg. Both flurbiprofen enantiomers are more than 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Plasma protein binding is relatively constant for the typical average steady-state concentrations (≤ 10 mcg/mL) achieved with recommended doses. Flurbiprofen is poorly excreted into human milk. The nursing infant dose is predicted to be approximately 0.1 mg/day in the established milk of a woman taking flurbiprofen tablets 200 mg/day (see PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers).<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Metabolism<BR>                           <BR>                              Several flurbiprofen metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. These metabolites include 4’-hydroxy-flurbiprofen, 3’,4’-dihydroxy-flurbiprofen, 3’-hydroxy-4’-methoxy-flurbiprofen, their conjugates, and conjugated flurbiprofen. Unlike other arylpropionic acid derivatives (e.g., ibuprofen), metabolism of R-flurbiprofen to S-flurbiprofen is minimal. In vitro studies have demonstrated that cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9) plays an important role in the metabolism of flurbiprofen to its major metabolite, 4’hydroxy-flurbiprofen (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations). The 4’-hydroxy- flurbiprofen metabolite showed little anti-inflammatory activity in animal models of inflammation. In vitro studies also demonstrated glucuronidation of both enantiomers of flurbiprofen and 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen. UGT2B7 is the predominant UGT isoenzyme responsible for the glucuronidation. Flurbiprofen does not induce enzymes that alter its metabolism.<BR>                              The total plasma clearance of unbound flurbiprofen is not stereoselective, and clearance of flurbiprofen is independent of dose when used within the therapeutic range.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Excretion<BR>                           <BR>                              Following dosing with flurbiprofen tablets, less than 3% of flurbiprofen is excreted unchanged in the urine, with about 70% of the dose eliminated in the urine as flurbiprofen, 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen, and their acyl-glucuronide conjugates. Because renal elimination is a significant pathway of elimination of flurbiprofen metabolites, dosing adjustment in patients with moderate or severe renal dysfunction may be necessary to avoid accumulation of flurbiprofen metabolites. The mean terminal disposition half-lives (t½) of R- and S-flurbiprofen are similar, about 4.7 and 5.7 hours, respectively. There is little accumulation of flurbiprofen following multiple doses of flurbiprofen tablets.<BR>                              <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3"

The unbound clearances of R- and S-flurbiprofen did not differ significantly between normal healthy volunteers (N = 6, 50 mg single dose) and patients with renal impairment (N = 8, inulin clearances ranging from 11 to 43 mL/min, 50 mg multiple doses). Flurbiprofen plasma protein binding may be decreased in patients with renal impairment and serum albumin concentrations below 3.9 g/dL. Elimination of flurbiprofen metabolites may be reduced in patients with renal impairment (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects).<BR>                              Flurbiprofen is not significantly removed from the blood into dialysate in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Drug-Drug Interactions<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           (see also PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions)<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Antacids<BR>                           <BR>                              Administration of flurbiprofen tablets to volunteers under fasting conditions or with antacid suspension yielded similar serum flurbiprofen-time profiles in young adult subjects (n = 12).
