Do not wait until the next planned dose.  If the time between two sequential infusions is 6 weeks or more, the initial dose of 840 mg PERJETA should be re-administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion followed every 3 weeks thereafter by a dose of 420 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 60 minutes.<BR>                        The infusion rate of PERJETA may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an infusion-associated reaction.
