There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between voriconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing voriconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.<BR>                     Coadministration of terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine with voriconazole is contraindicated because increased plasma concentrations of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsade de pointes [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                        ].<BR>                     Coadministration of voriconazole with sirolimus is contraindicated because voriconazole significantly increases sirolimus concentrations [see <BR>                              Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           <BR>                        ].<BR>                     Coadministration of voriconazole with rifampin, carbamazepine and long-acting barbiturates is contraindicated because these drugs are likely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly [see <BR>                              Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           <BR>                        ].<BR>                     Coadministration of voriconazole with high-dose ritonavir (400 mg q12h) is contraindicated because ritonavir (400 mg q12h) significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations. Coadministration of voriconazole and low-dose ritonavir (100 mg q12h) should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                        ].<BR>                     Coadministration of voriconazole with rifabutin is contraindicated since voriconazole significantly increases rifabutin plasma concentrations and rifabutin also significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations [see <BR>                              Drug Interactions (7)<BR>                            and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                        ].<BR>                     Coadministration of voriconazole with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) is contraindicated because voriconazole may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids, which may lead to ergotism [see <BR>                              Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           <BR>                        ].<BR>                     Coadministration of voriconazole with St. John’s Wort is contraindicated because this herbal supplement may decrease voriconazole plasma concentration [see<BR>                               Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)<BR>                           <BR>                        ].<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Hypersensitivity to voriconazole or its excipients.<BR>                           To reduce risk of serious adverse events, do not use voriconazole with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine, sirolimus (4, 7)<BR>                           To prevent loss of voriconazole efficacy, do not use with rifampin, carbamazepine, long-acting barbiturates, ritonavir, rifabutin, ergot alkaloids and St. John’s Wort (4, 7)<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
