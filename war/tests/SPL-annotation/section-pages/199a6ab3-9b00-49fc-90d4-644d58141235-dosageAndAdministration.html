CISPLATIN INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN BY RAPID INTRAVENOUS INJECTION.<BR>                  <BR>                     Note: Needles or intravenous sets containing aluminum parts that may come in contact with cisplatin injection should not be used for preparation or administration. Aluminum reacts with cisplatin injection, causing precipitate formation and a loss of potency.<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     Metastatic Testicular Tumors<BR>                     <BR>                        The usual cisplatin injection dose for the treatment of testicular cancer in combination with other approved chemotherapeutic agents is 20 mg/m2 IV daily for 5 days per cycle.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     Metastatic Ovarian Tumors<BR>                     <BR>                        The usual Cisplatin injection dose for the treatment of metastatic ovarian tumors in combination with cyclophosphamide is 75–100 mg/m2 IV per cycle once every four weeks (DAY 1). <BR>                        The dose of cyclophosphamide when used in combination with Cisplatin injection is 600 mg/m2 IV once every 4 weeks (DAY 1). <BR>                        For directions for the administration of cyclophosphamide, refer to the cyclophosphamide package insert. <BR>                        In combination therapy, Cisplatin injection and cyclophosphamide are administered sequentially. <BR>                        As a single agent, Cisplatin injection should be administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 IV per cycle once every four weeks.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     Advanced Bladder Cancer<BR>                     <BR>                        Cisplatin injection should be administered as a single agent at a dose of 50 to 70 mg/m2 IV per cycle once every 3 to 4 weeks depending on the extent of prior exposure to radiation therapy and/or prior chemotherapy. For heavily pretreated patients an initial dose of 50 mg/m2 per cycle repeated every 4 weeks is recommended. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     All Patients<BR>                     <BR>                        Pretreatment hydration with 1 to 2 liters of fluid infused for 8 to 12 hours prior to a cisplatin injection dose is recommended. The drug is then diluted in 2 liters of 5% Dextrose in 1/2 or 1/3 normal saline containing 37.5 g of mannitol, and infused over a   6 to 8 hour period. If diluted solution is not to be used within 6 hours, protect solution from light. Do not dilute cisplatin injection in just 5% Dextrose Injection. Adequate hydration and urinary output must be maintained during the following 24 hours.<BR>                        A repeat course of cisplatin injection should not be given until the serum creatinine is below 1.5 mg/100 mL, and/or the BUN is below 25 mg/100 mL. A repeat course should not be given until circulating blood elements are at an acceptable level (platelets ≥100,000/mm3, WBC ≥4,000/mm3). Subsequent doses of cisplatin injection should not be given until an audiometric analysis indicates that auditory acuity is within normal limits. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
