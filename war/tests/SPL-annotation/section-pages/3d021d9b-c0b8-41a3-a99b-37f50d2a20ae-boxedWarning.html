Clopidogrel <BR>                  bisulfate at recommended doses forms less of that metabolite and has a smaller effect on platelet function in patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.  Poor metabolizers with acute coronary syndrome or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention treated with clopidogrel bisulfate at recommended doses exhibit higher cardiovascular event rates than do patients with normal CYP2C19 function. Tests are available to identify a patient's CYP2C19 genotype; these tests can be used as an aid in determining therapeutic strategy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. Consider alternative treatment or treatment strategies in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR><BR>                        WARNING:<BR>                        DIMINISHED EFFECTIVENESS IN POOR METABOLIZERS<BR>                        <BR> <BR><BR>                        <BR>                           See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.<BR><BR>                           <BR>                         <BR>                           <BR>                              Effectiveness of clopidogrel bisulfate depends on activation to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally CYP2C19.
