Letrozole may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant <BR>woman and the clinical benefit to premenopausal women with breast cancer has not <BR>been demonstrated. Letrozole is contraindicated in women who are or may become <BR>pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes <BR>pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential <BR>hazard to a fetus. <BR>                        Letrozole caused adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital <BR>malformations, in rats and rabbits at doses much smaller than the daily maximum <BR>recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis. Effects <BR>included increased post-implantation pregnancy loss and resorptions, fewer live <BR>fetuses, and fetal malformations affecting the renal and skeletal systems. <BR>Animal data and letrozole’s mechanism of action raise concerns that letrozole <BR>could be a human teratogen as well. <BR>                        Reproduction studies in rats showed embryo and fetal toxicity at letrozole <BR>doses during organogenesis equal to or greater than 1/100 the daily maximum <BR>recommended human dose (MHRD) (mg/m2 basis). Adverse <BR>effects included: intrauterine mortality; increased resorptions and <BR>postimplantation loss; decreased numbers of live fetuses; and fetal anomalies <BR>including absence and shortening of renal papilla, dilation of ureter, edema and <BR>incomplete ossification of frontal skull and metatarsals. Letrozole doses 1/10 <BR>the daily MHRD (mg/m2 basis) caused fetal domed head and <BR>cervical/centrum vertebral fusion. In rabbits, letrozole caused embryo and fetal <BR>toxicity at doses about 1/100,000 and 1/10,000 the daily MHRD respectively <BR>(mg/m2 basis). Fetal anomalies included incomplete <BR>ossification of the skull, sternebrae and fore- and hind legs [see Nonclinical <BR>Toxicology (13.2)].<BR>                        <BR>                        Physicians should discuss the need for adequate contraception with women who <BR>are recently menopausal. Contraception should be used until postmenopausal <BR>status is clinically well established. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        It is not known if letrozole is excreted in human milk. Because <BR>many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious <BR>adverse reactions in nursing infants from letrozole, a decision should be made <BR>whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account <BR>the importance of the drug to the mother. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4 Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been <BR>established. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5 Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        The median age of patients in all studies of first-line and <BR>second-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer was 64 to 65 years. About 1/3 <BR>of the patients were > 70 years old. In the first-line study, patients ≥70 years <BR>of age experienced longer time to tumor progression and higher response rates <BR>than patients < 70. <BR>                        For the extended adjuvant setting, more than 5,100 postmenopausal women were <BR>enrolled in the clinical study. In total, 41% of patients were aged 65 years or <BR>older at enrollment, while 12% were 75 or older. In the extended adjuvant <BR>setting, no overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between <BR>these older patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical <BR>experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and <BR>younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be <BR>ruled out. <BR>                        In the adjuvant setting, more than 8,000 postmenopausal women were enrolled <BR>in the clinical study. In total, 36 % of patients were aged 65 years or older at <BR>enrollment, while 12% were 75 or older. More adverse reactions were generally <BR>reported in elderly patients irrespective of study treatment allocation. <BR>However, in comparison to tamoxifen, no overall differences with regards to the <BR>safety and efficacy profiles were observed between elderly patients and younger <BR>patients. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
