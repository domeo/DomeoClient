Maintenance doses will vary from patient to patient. The usual daily maintenance dose of Mercaptopurine Tablets is 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg/day as a single dose. It is to be emphasized that in pediatric patients with acute lymphatic leukemia in remission, superior results have been obtained when Mercaptopurine Tablets have been combined with other agents (most frequently with methotrexate) for remission maintenance. Mercaptopurine Tablets should rarely be relied upon as a single agent for the maintenance of remissions induced in acute leukemia.<BR>                        Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.1-8 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Dosage with concomitant Allopurinol<BR>                     <BR>                        When allopurinol and mercaptopurine are administered concomitantly, the dose of mercaptopurine must be reduced to one-third to one-quarter of the usual dose to avoid severe toxicity.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Dosage in TPMT-deficient Patients<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients with inherited little or no thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity are at increased risk for severe mercaptopurine toxicity from conventional doses of mercaptopurine and generally require substantial dose reduction. The optimal starting dose for homozygous deficient patients has not been established (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections).<BR>                        Most patients with heterozygous TPMT deficiency tolerated recommended mercaptopurine doses, but some required dose reduction. Genotypic and phenotypic testing of TPMT status are available (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections). <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Dosage in Renal and Hepatic Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        It is probably advisable to start with lower dosages in patients with impaired renal function, due to slower elimination of the drug and metabolites and a greater cumulative effect. Consideration should be given to reducing the dosage in patients with impaired hepatic function.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
