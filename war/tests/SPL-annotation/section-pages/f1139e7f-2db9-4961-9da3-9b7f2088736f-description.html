Each orange, film-coated tablet contains the active ingredients 600 mg of abacavir as abacavir sulfate and 300 mg of lamivudine, and the inactive ingredients magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium starch glycolate. The tablets are coated with a film (OPADRY® orange YS-1-13065-A) that is made of FD&C Yellow No. 6, hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 400, polysorbate 80, and titanium dioxide.<BR>                  <BR>                     Abacavir Sulfate: The chemical name of abacavir sulfate is (1S<BR>                     ,cis<BR>                     )-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol sulfate (salt) (2:1). Abacavir sulfate is the enantiomer with 1S, 4R absolute configuration on the cyclopentene ring. It has a molecular formula of (C14H18N6O)2<BR>                     •H2SO4 and a molecular weight of 670.76 daltons. It has the following structural formula:<BR>                  <BR>                  Abacavir sulfate is a white to off-white solid with a solubility of approximately 77 mg/mL in distilled water at 25°C.<BR>                  In vivo, abacavir sulfate dissociates to its free base, abacavir. All dosages for abacavir sulfate are expressed in terms of abacavir.<BR>                  <BR>                     Lamivudine: The chemical name of lamivudine is (2R,cis)-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidin-2-one. Lamivudine is the (-)enantiomer of a dideoxy analogue of cytidine. Lamivudine has also been referred to as (-)2′,3′-dideoxy, 3′-thiacytidine. It has a molecular formula of C8H11N3O3S and a molecular weight of 229.3 daltons. It has the following structural formula:<BR>                  <BR>                  Lamivudine is a white to off-white crystalline solid with a solubility of approximately 70 mg/mL in water at 20°C.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     abacavir sulfate structural formula<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     Lamivudine chemical structure<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
