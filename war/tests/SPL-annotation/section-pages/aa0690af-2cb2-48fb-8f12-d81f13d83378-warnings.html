However, prolonged visual disturbances have been reported after clomiPHENE citrate therapy has been discontinued and these disturbances may be irreversible. Patients should be warned that these visual symptoms may render such activities as driving a car or operating machinery more hazardous than usual, particularly under conditions of variable lighting.<BR>                  These visual symptoms appear to be due to intensification and prolongation of afterimages. Symptoms often first appear or are accentuated with exposure to a brightly lit environment.  While measured visual acuity usually has not been affected, a study patient taking 200 mg clomiPHENE citrate daily developed visual blurring on the 7th day of treatment, which progressed to severe diminution of visual acuity by the 10th day.  No other abnormality was found, and the visual acuity returned to normal on the 3rd day after treatment was stopped.<BR>                  Ophthalmologically definable scotomata and retinal cell function (electroretinographic) changes have also been reported.  A patient treated during clinical studies developed phosphenes and scotomata during prolonged clomiPHENE citrate administration, which disappeared by the 32nd day after stopping therapy.<BR>                  Postmarketing surveillance of adverse events has also revealed other visual signs and symptoms during clomiPHENE citrate therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).<BR>                  While the etiology of these visual symptoms is not yet understood, patients with any visual symptoms should discontinue treatment and have a complete ophthalmological evaluation carried out promptly.<BR>                  <BR>                     Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome<BR>                  <BR>                  The ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been reported to occur in patients receiving clomiPHENE citrate therapy for ovulation induction.  In some cases, OHSS occurred following cyclic use of clomiPHENE citrate therapy or when clomiPHENE citrate was used in combination with gonadotropins.  Transient liver function test abnormalities suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, which may be accompanied by morphologic changes on liver biopsy, have been reported in association with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).<BR>                  OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement. It may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event. The clinical signs of this syndrome in severe cases can include gross ovarian enlargement, gastrointestinal symptoms, ascites, dyspnea, oliguria, and pleural effusion.  In addition, the following symptoms have been reported in association with this syndrome: pericardial effusion, anasarca, hydrothorax, acute abdomen, hypotension, renal failure, pulmonary edema, intraperitoneal and ovarian hemorrhage, deep venous thrombosis, torsion of the ovary, and acute respiratory distress.  The early warning signs of OHSS are abdominal pain and distention, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight gain.  Elevated urinary steroid levels, varying degrees of electrolyte imbalance, hypovolemia, hemoconcentration, and hypoproteinemia may occur.  Death due to hypovolemic shock, hemoconcentration, or thromboembolism has occurred.  Due to fragility of enlarged ovaries in severe cases, abdominal and pelvic examination should be performed very cautiously.  If conception results, rapid progression to the severe form of the syndrome may occur.<BR>                  To minimize the hazard associated with occasional abnormal ovarian enlargement associated with clomiPHENE citrate therapy, the lowest dose consistent with expected clinical results should be used.  Maximal enlargement of the ovary, whether physiologic or abnormal, may not occur until several days after discontinuation of the recommended dose of clomiPHENE citrate.  Some patients with polycystic ovary syndrome who are unusually sensitive to gonadotropin may have an exaggerated response to usual doses of clomiPHENE citrate.  Therefore, patients with polycystic ovary syndrome should be started on the lowest recommended dose and shortest treatment duration for the first course of therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).<BR>                  If enlargement of the ovary occurs, additional clomiPHENE citrate therapy should not be given until the ovaries have returned to pretreatment size, and the dosage or duration of the next course should be reduced.  Ovarian enlargement and cyst formation associated with clomiPHENE citrate therapy usually regress spontaneously within a few days or weeks after discontinuing treatment.  The potential benefit of subsequent clomiPHENE citrate therapy in these cases should exceed the risk.  Unless surgical indication for laparotomy exists, such cystic enlargement should always be managed conservatively.<BR>                  A causal relationship between ovarian hyperstimulation and ovarian cancer has not been determined.  However, because a correlation between ovarian cancer and nulliparity, infertility, and age has been suggested, if ovarian cysts do not regress spontaneously, a thorough evaluation should be performed to rule out the presence of ovarian neoplasia.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
