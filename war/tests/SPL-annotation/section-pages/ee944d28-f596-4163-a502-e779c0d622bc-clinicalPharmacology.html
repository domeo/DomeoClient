Approximately 55% of the drug in<BR>the plasma is bound to nondiffusible plasma constituents. Excretion of chloroquine is quite slow,<BR>but is increased by acidification of the urine. Chloroquine is deposited in the tissues in considerable<BR>amounts. In animals, from 200 to 700 times the plasma concentration may be found in the liver,<BR>spleen, kidney, and lung; leukocytes also concentrate the drug. The brain and spinal cord, in<BR>contrast, contain only 10 to 30 times the amount present in plasma.<BR>                  Chloroquine undergoes appreciable degradation in the body. The main metabolite is<BR>desethylchloroquine, which accounts for one fourth of the total material appearing in the urine;<BR>bisdesethylchloroquine, a carboxylic acid derivative, and other metabolic products as yet<BR>uncharacterized are found in small amounts. Slightly more than half of the urinary drug products<BR>can be accounted for as unchanged chloroquine.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Microbiology<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Mechanism of Action:<BR>                           <BR>                              Chloroquine is an antimalarial agent. While the drug can inhibit certain<BR>enzymes, its effect is believed to result, at least in part, from its interaction with DNA. However, the<BR>mechanism of plasmodicidal action of chloroquine is not completely certain.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Activity in vitro and in vivo:<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              Chloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of Plasmodium vivax. Plasmodium malariae, and susceptible strains of Plasmodium falciparum (but not the gametocytes of P. falciparum). It is not effective against exoerythrocytic forms of the parasite.<BR>                              <BR>                                 In vitro studies with trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica have demonstrated that chloroquineÂ also possesses amebicidal activity comparable to that of emetine.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           Drug Resistance:<BR>                           <BR>                              Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine is widespread and cases of Plasmodium vivax resistance have been reported.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
