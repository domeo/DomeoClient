Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of lansoprazole (a racemic mixture of the <BR>R- and S-enantiomers). Its <BR>empirical formula is: C16H14F3N3O2S, with a <BR>molecular weight of 369.36. The structural formula is:<BR>                  Dexlansoprazole is a white to nearly white crystalline powder which melts <BR>with decomposition at 140Â°C. Dexlansoprazole is freely soluble in <BR>dimethylformamide, methanol, dichloromethane, ethanol, and ethyl acetate; and <BR>soluble in acetonitrile; slightly soluble in ether; and very slightly soluble in <BR>water; and practically insoluble in hexane.<BR>                  Dexlansoprazole is stable when exposed to light. Dexlansoprazole is more <BR>stable in neutral and alkaline conditions than acidic conditions.<BR>                  KAPIDEX is supplied as a dual delayed release formulation in capsules for <BR>oral administration. The capsules contain dexlansoprazole in a mixture of two <BR>types of enteric-coated granules with different pH-dependent dissolution <BR>profiles [see Clinical Pharmacology <BR>(12.3)].<BR>                  KAPIDEX is available in two dosage strengths: 30 mg and 60 mg, per capsule. <BR>Each capsule contains enteric-coated granules consisting of dexlansoprazole <BR>(active ingredient) and the following inactive ingredients: sugar spheres, <BR>magnesium carbonate, sucrose, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, titanium <BR>dioxide, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose 2910, talc, methacrylic acid <BR>copolymer, polyethylene glycol 8000, triethyl citrate, polysorbate 80, and <BR>colloidal silicon dioxide. The components of the capsule shell include the <BR>following inactive ingredients: hypromellose, carrageenan and potassium <BR>chloride. Based on the capsule shell color, blue contains FD&C Blue No. 2 <BR>and aluminum lake; gray contains ferric oxide and aluminum lake; and both <BR>contain titanium dioxide.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     image of Kapidex chemical structure<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
