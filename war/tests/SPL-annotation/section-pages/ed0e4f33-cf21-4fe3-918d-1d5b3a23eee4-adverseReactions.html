More patients treated with INCIVEK combination treatment had decreases in mean platelet values of all grades: 47% compared to 36% treated with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone. Three percent of INCIVEK combination treatment subjects had decreases to 49,999/mm3 or less compared to 1% of those treated with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin-treated alone.<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                          <BR>                                             Bilirubin: Forty one percent of subjects treated with INCIVEK compared to 28% of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin-treated subjects had all grade elevations in bilirubin levels; 4% and 2% of subjects, respectively, had greater than or equal to 2.6 x ULN elevations. Bilirubin levels increased most steeply during the first 1 to 2 weeks of INCIVEK dosing, stabilized and between Weeks 12 and 16 were at baseline levels.<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                                 <BR>                                    <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                          <BR>                                             Uric Acid: During the INCIVEK combination treatment period, 73% of subjects had elevated uric acid levels compared to 29% for those treated with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone. Shifts to greater than or equal to 12.1 mg per dL from baseline in uric acid levels were also more frequent among subjects treated with INCIVEK (7%) compared to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (1%). Less than 1% of subjects had clinical events of gout/gouty arthritis; none were serious and none resulted in treatment discontinuation.<BR>                                       <BR>                                       <BR>                                    <BR>                                 <BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     6.2 Post-marketing Experience<BR>                     <BR>                        The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of INCIVEK.
