The cDNA coding for rasburicase was cloned from a strain of Aspergillus flavus.<BR>                  Rasburicase is a tetrameric protein with identical subunits. Each subunit is made up of a single 301 amino acid polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of about 34 kDa. The drug product is a sterile, white to off-white, lyophilized powder intended for intravenous administration following reconstitution with a diluent. Elitek is supplied in 3 mL and 10 mL colorless, glass vials containing rasburicase at a concentration of 1.5 mg/mL after reconstitution.<BR>                  Elitek 1.5 mg presentation contains 1.5 mg rasburicase, 10.6 mg mannitol, 15.9 mg L-alanine, between 12.6 and 14.3 mg of dibasic sodium phosphate (lyophilized powder), and a diluent (1 mL Water for Injection, USP, and 1 mg Poloxamer 188).<BR>                  Elitek 7.5 mg presentation contains 7.5 mg of rasburicase, 53 mg mannitol, 79.5 mg L-alanine, and between 63 and 71.5 mg dibasic sodium phosphate (lyophilized powder) and a diluent (5 mL Water for Injection, USP, and 5 mg Poloxamer 188).<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
