The dose for patients weighing greater than 100 kg should be calculated based on a weight of 100 kg.<BR>                        Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus.<BR>                        Continue treatment until a maximum of 16 cycles, disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.2 Dose Modification<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Peripheral Neuropathy:  Peripheral neuropathy should be managed using a combination of dose delay and reduction to 1.2 mg/kg. For new or worsening Grade 2 or 3 neuropathy, dosing should be held until neuropathy improves to Grade 1 or baseline and then restarted at 1.2 mg/kg. For Grade 4 peripheral neuropathy, ADCETRIS should be discontinued.<BR>                        <BR>                           Neutropenia:  Neutropenia should be managed by dose delays and reductions. The dose of ADCETRIS should be held for Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia until resolution to baseline or Grade 2 or lower. Growth factor support should be considered for subsequent cycles in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. In patients with recurrent Grade 4 neutropenia despite the use of growth factors, discontinuation or dose reduction of ADCETRIS to1.2 mg/kg may be considered.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     2.3 Instructions for Preparation and Administration<BR>                     <BR>                        Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published [see References (15)<BR>                           ].<BR>                        Use appropriate aseptic technique for reconstitution and preparation of dosing solutions.<BR>                        <BR>                           Reconstitution<BR>                        <BR>                        Calculate the dose (mg) and number of vials of ADCETRIS required. The dose for patients weighing greater than 100 kg should be calculated based on a weight of 100 kg. Reconstitute each 50 mg vial of ADCETRIS with 10.5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to yield a single-use solution containing 5 mg/mL brentuximab vedotin. Direct the stream toward wall of vial and not directly at the cake or powder. Gently swirl the vial to aid dissolution. DO NOT SHAKE. Inspect the reconstituted solution for particulates and discoloration. The reconstituted solution should be clear to slightly opalescent, colorless, and free of visible particulates. Following reconstitution, dilute immediately into an infusion bag, or store the solution at 2-8˚C (36-46˚F) and use within 24 hours of reconstitution. DO NOT FREEZE. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.<BR>                        <BR>                           Dilution<BR>                        <BR>                        Calculate the required volume of 5 mg/mL reconstituted ADCETRIS solution needed and withdraw this amount from the vials. The dose for patients weighing greater than 100 kg should be calculated based on a weight of 100 kg. Immediately add the reconstituted solution to an infusion bag containing a minimum volume of 100 mL to achieve a final concentration of 0.4 mg/mL to 1.8 mg/mL brentuximab vedotin. ADCETRIS can be diluted into 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 5% Dextrose Injection or Lactated Ringer's Injection. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. ADCETRIS contains no bacteriostatic preservatives. Following dilution, infuse the ADCETRIS solution immediately, or store the solution at 2-8˚C (36-46˚F) and use within 24 hours of reconstitution.
