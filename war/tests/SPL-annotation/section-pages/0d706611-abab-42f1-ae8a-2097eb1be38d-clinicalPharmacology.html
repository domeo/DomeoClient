The CD20 molecule is expressed on normal B lymphocytes (pre-B lymphocytes to mature B lymphocytes) and on B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The CD20 molecule is not shed from the cell surface and is not internalized following antibody binding. The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen induces cell death by emitting ionizing radiation to CD20-expressing lymphocytes or neighboring cells. In addition to cell death mediated by the radioisotope, other possible mechanisms of action include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and CD20-mediated apoptosis.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics<BR>                     <BR>                        In two clinical studies (one in chemotherapy-naive patients and one in heavily pretreated patients), the administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen resulted in sustained depletion of circulating CD20-positive cells. The assessment of circulating lymphocytes in these patients did not distinguish normal from malignant cells; consequently, recovery of normal B cell numbers was not directly assessed. At 7 weeks following treatment, the median number of circulating CD20-positive cells was zero (range: 0 to 490 cells/mm3) with recovery beginning at approximately 12 weeks. At 6 months following treatment, 8 (14%) of 58 chemotherapy-naive patients and 6 (32%) of 19 heavily pretreated patients had CD20-positive cell counts below normal limits. There was no consistent effect of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen on post-treatment serum IgG, IgA, or IgM levels.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        A pharmacokinetic study of I-131 tositumomab determined that a 475-mg predose of unlabeled antibody decreased splenic targeting and increased the terminal half-life of the radiolabeled antibody. The median blood clearance following administration of 485 mg of tositumomab in 110 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas was 68.2 mg/hr (range: 30.2 to 260.8 mg/hr). Patients with high tumor burden, splenomegaly, or bone marrow involvement were noted to have a larger volume of distribution, faster clearance, and shorter terminal half-life. The total body clearance, as measured by total body gamma camera counts, was dependent on the same factors noted for blood clearance. Patient-specific dosing, based on total body clearance, provided a consistent radiation dose despite variable pharmacokinetics, by allowing each patient’s administered activity to be adjusted for individual patient variables. The median total body effective half-life, as measured by total body gamma camera counts, in 980 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was 67 hours (range: 28 to 115 hours).<BR>                        Elimination of Iodine-131 occurs by decay (Table 5) and excretion in the urine. Five days following the dose, the whole body clearance was 67% of the injected dose. Ninety-eight percent (98%) of the clearance was accounted for in the urine.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
