Anyone considering the use of protriptyline hydrochloride <BR>or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance <BR>this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in <BR>the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults <BR>beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to <BR>placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric <BR>disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. <BR>Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be <BR>monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, <BR>suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be <BR>advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. <BR>Protriptyline hydrochloride is not approved for use in pediatric patients.
