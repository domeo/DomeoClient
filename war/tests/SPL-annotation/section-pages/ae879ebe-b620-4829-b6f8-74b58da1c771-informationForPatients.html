If peginterferon alfa or ribavirin is permanently discontinued, VICTRELIS must also be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.1	Pregnancy<BR>                     <BR>                        Ribavirin must not be used by women who are pregnant or by men whose female partners are pregnant. Ribavirin therapy should not be initiated until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately before starting therapy. Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must be advised of the teratogenic/embryocidal risks of ribavirin and must be instructed to practice effective contraception during therapy and for 6 months post-therapy. Patients should be advised to notify the healthcare provider immediately in the event of a pregnancy [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].<BR>                        <BR>                        Women of childbearing potential and men must use at least two forms of effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after treatment has been stopped; routine monthly pregnancy tests must be performed during this time. One of these reliable forms of contraception can be a combined oral contraceptive product containing at least 1 mg of norethindrone. Oral contraceptives containing lower doses of norethindrone and other forms of hormonal contraception have not been studied or are contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].<BR>                        <BR>                        To monitor maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to ribavirin, the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry has been established. Patients should be encouraged to register by calling 1-800-593-2214.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.2	Anemia<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be informed that anemia may be increased when VICTRELIS is administered with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients should be advised that laboratory evaluations are required prior to starting therapy and periodically thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.3	Neutropenia<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be informed that neutropenia may be increased when VICTRELIS is administered with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients should be advised that laboratory evaluations are required prior to starting therapy and periodically thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.4	Hypersensitivity<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be informed that serious acute hypersensitivity reactions have been observed during combination therapy with VICTRELIS, peginterferon alfa, and ribavirin therapy [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].  If symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., itching; hives; swelling of the face, eyes, lips, tongue, or throat; trouble breathing or swallowing) occur, patients should seek medical advice promptly.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.5	Usage Safeguards<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be advised that VICTRELIS must not be used alone due to the high probability of resistance without combination anti-HCV therapies [see Indications and Usage (1)]. See peginterferon alfa and ribavirin Package Inserts for additional patient counseling information on the use of these drugs in combination with VICTRELIS.<BR>                        Patients should be informed of the potential for serious drug interactions with VICTRELIS, and that some drugs should not be taken with VICTRELIS [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                        Patients should be advised that the total daily dose of VICTRELIS is packaged into a single bottle containing 12-capsules and the patient should take four capsules three times daily with food.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.6	Missed VICTRELIS Doses<BR>                     <BR>                        If a patient misses a dose and it is less than 2 hours before the next dose is due, the missed dose should be skipped. If a patient misses a dose and it is 2 or more hours before the next dose is due, the patient should take the missed dose with food and resume the normal dosing schedule.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.7	Hepatitis C Virus Transmission<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be informed that the effect of treatment of hepatitis C infection on transmission is not known, and that appropriate precautions to prevent transmission of the hepatitis C virus should be taken.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
