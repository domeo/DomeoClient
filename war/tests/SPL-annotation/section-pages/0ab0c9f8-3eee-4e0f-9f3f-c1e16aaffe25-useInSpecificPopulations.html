There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of KALYDECO in pregnant women. Ivacaftor was not teratogenic in rats at approximately 6 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at a maternal dose of 200 mg/kg/day). Ivacaftor was not teratogenic in rabbits at approximately 12 times the MRHD (on an ivacaftor AUC basis at a maternal dose of 100 mg/kg/day, respectively). Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, KALYDECO should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        Ivacaftor is excreted into the milk of lactating female rats. Excretion of ivacaftor into human milk is probable. There are no human studies that have investigated the effects of ivacaftor on breast-fed infants. Caution should be exercised when KALYDECO is administered to a nursing woman.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4 Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        The safety and efficacy of KALYDECO in patients 6 to 17 years of age with CF who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene has been demonstrated in 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials. Trial 1 evaluated 161 patients with CF who were 12 years of age or older and Trial 2 evaluated 52 patients with CF who were 6 to 11 years of age [see <BR>                              Clinical Studies (14.1)<BR>                           ].<BR>                        The safety and efficacy of KALYDECO in patients with CF younger than age 6 years have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5 Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        CF is largely a disease of children and young adults.

A reduced dose of 150 mg once daily is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) but exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, use with caution at a dose of 150 mg once daily or less frequently in patients with severe hepatic impairment after weighing the risks and benefit of treatment [see <BR>                              Pharmacokinetics (12.3)<BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.7	Renal Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        KALYDECO has not been studied in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment or in patients with end stage renal disease. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment; however, caution is recommended while using KALYDECO in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) or end stage renal disease. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.8	Patients with CF who are Homozygous for the F508del Mutation in the CFTR Gene<BR>                     <BR>                        Efficacy results from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene showed no statistically significant difference in forced expiratory volume exhaled in one second (FEV1) over 16 weeks of KALYDECO treatment compared to placebo [see <BR>                              Clinical Studies (14.2)<BR>                           ]. Therefore, KALYDECO should not be used in patients homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
