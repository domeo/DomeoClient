Fetal drug levels were 3-5% of maternal levels, indicating that vemurafenib has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus.  There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential and men should be advised to use appropriate contraceptive measures during ZELBORAF therapy and for at least 2 months after discontinuation of ZELBORAF.  If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3	Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        It is not known whether vemurafenib is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from ZELBORAF in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4	Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5	Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        Ninety-four (28%) of 336 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma treated with ZELBORAF in Trial 1 were ≥ 65 years. Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) may be more likely to experience some adverse reactions, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, nausea, decreased appetite, peripheral edema, keratoacanthoma and atrial fibrillation. The effects of ZELBORAF on overall survival, progression-free survival and best overall response rate were similar in the elderly as compared to younger patients.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.6	Gender<BR>                     <BR>                        The Grade 3 adverse events reported more frequently in females than males were rash, arthralgia, photosensitivity and increased creatinine. The Grade 3 adverse events reported more frequently in males than females were keratoacanthoma, increased alkaline phosphatase and increased total bilirubin.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.7	Hepatic Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        No adjustment to the starting dose is needed for patients with pre-existing mild and moderate hepatic impairment.  In the population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from clinical trials in patients with metastatic melanoma, pre-existing mild and moderate hepatic impairment did not influence the apparent clearance of vemurafenib.  Clinical and pharmacokinetic data from only three patients with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment are available from clinical trials, and based on the limited data, the potential need for starting dose adjustment cannot be determined.  ZELBORAF should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.8	Renal Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        No adjustment to the starting dose is needed for patients with pre-existing mild and moderate renal impairment.
