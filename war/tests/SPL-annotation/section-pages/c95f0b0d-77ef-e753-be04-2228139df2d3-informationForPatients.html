Effective therapeutic levels with minimal complications are in part dependent upon cooperative and well-instructed patients who communicate effectively with their physician. Patients should be advised: Strict adherence to prescribed dosage schedule is necessary. Do not take or discontinue any other medication, including salicylates (e.g., aspirin and topical analgesics), other over-the-counter medications, and botanical (herbal) products except on advice of the physician. Avoid alcohol consumption. Do not take warfarin sodium tablets during pregnancy and do not become pregnant while taking it (see <BR>                        CONTRAINDICATIONS). Avoid any activity or sport that may result in traumatic injury. Prothrombin time tests and regular visits to physician or clinic are needed to monitor therapy. Carry identification stating that warfarin sodium tablets are being taken. If the prescribed dose of warfarin sodium tablets is forgotten, notify the physician immediately. Take the dose as soon as possible on the same day but do not take a double dose of warfarin sodium tablets the next day to make up for missed doses. The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with warfarin sodium tablets. Eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables. You should also avoid intake of cranberry juice or any other cranberry products. Notify your healthcare provider if any of these products are part of your normal diet. Contact physician to report any illness, such as diarrhea, infection or fever. Notify physician immediately if any unusual bleeding or symptoms occur. Signs and symptoms of bleeding include: pain, swelling or discomfort, prolonged bleeding from cuts, increased menstrual flow or vaginal bleeding, nosebleeds, bleeding of gums from brushing, unusual bleeding or bruising, red or dark brown urine, red or tar black stools, headache, dizziness, or weakness. If therapy with warfarin sodium tablets is discontinued, patients should be cautioned that the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium tablets may persist for about 2 to 5 days. Patients should be informed that all warfarin sodium, USP, products represent the same medication, and should not be taken concomitantly, as overdosage may result. A Medication Guide14 should be available to patients when their prescriptions for warfarin sodium are issued.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility<BR>                     <BR>                        Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity studies have not been performed with warfarin sodium tablets. The reproductive effects of warfarin sodium tablets have not been evaluated. The use of warfarin during pregnancy has been associated with the development of fetal malformations in humans (see <BR>                              CONTRAINDICATIONS).<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     Use in Pregnancy<BR>                     <BR>                        Pregnancy Category X - see <BR>                              CONTRAINDICATIONS.<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
