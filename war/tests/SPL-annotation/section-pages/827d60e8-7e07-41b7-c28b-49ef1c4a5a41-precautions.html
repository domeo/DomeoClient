Discontinuation of IRESSA should be considered if changes are severe.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Patients with Hepatic Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           In vitro and in vivo evidence suggest that gefitinib is cleared primarily by the liver.  Therefore, gefitinib exposure may be increased in patients with hepatic dysfunction.  In patients with liver metastases and moderately to severely elevated biochemical liver abnormalities, however, gefitinib pharmacokinetics were similar to the pharmacokinetics of individuals without liver abnormalities (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Pharmacokinetics- Special Populations<BR>                            section).  The influence of non-cancer related hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of gefitinib has not been evaluated.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Information for Patients<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop 1) severe or persistent diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, or vomiting, as these have sometimes been associated with dehydration; 2) an onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms, ie, shortness of breath or cough; 3) an eye irritation; or, 4) any other new symptom (see <BR>                              WARNINGS-Pulmonary Toxicity<BR>                           , <BR>                              ADVERSE REACTIONS<BR>                            and <BR>                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION-Dosage Adjustment<BR>                            sections).<BR>                        Women of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid becoming pregnant (see <BR>                              WARNINGS-Pregnancy Category D<BR>                           ).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Drug Interactions<BR>                     <BR>                        Substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity increase the metabolism of gefitinib and decrease its plasma concentrations. In patients receiving a potent CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampicin or phenytoin, a dose increase to 500 mg daily should be considered in the absence of severe adverse drug reaction, and clinical response and adverse events should be carefully monitored (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Pharmacokinetics-Drug-Drug Interactions<BR>                           and <BR>                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION-Dosage Adjustment<BR>                            sections).<BR>                        International Normalized Ratio (INR) elevations and/or bleeding events have been reported in some patients taking warfarin while on IRESSA therapy. Patients taking warfarin should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time or INR (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Pharmacokinetics-Drug-Drug Interactions<BR>                            and <BR>                              ADVERSE REACTIONS<BR>                            sections).<BR>                        Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, ketoconazole and itraconazole) decrease gefitinib metabolism and increase gefitinib plasma concentrations. This increase may be clinically relevant as adverse experiences are related to dose and exposure; therefore, caution should be used when administering CYP3A4 inhibitors with IRESSA  (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Pharmacokinetics-Drug-Drug Interactions<BR>                            and <BR>                              ADVERSE REACTIONS<BR>                            sections).<BR>                        Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH (histamine H2-receptor antagonists such as ranitidine or cimetidine) may reduce plasma concentrations of IRESSA and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Drug-Drug Interactions<BR>                            section).<BR>                        Phase II clinical trial data, where IRESSA and vinorelbine have been used concomitantly, indicate that IRESSA may exacerbate the neutropenic effect of vinorelbine.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility<BR>                     <BR>                        Gefitinib has been tested for genotoxicity in a series of in vitro (bacterial mutation, mouse lymphoma, and human lymphocyte) assays and an in vivo rat micronucleus test.

Following oral administration of carbon-14 labeled gefitinib to rats 14 days postpartum, concentrations of radioactivity in milk were higher than in blood.  Levels of gefitinib and its metabolites were 11-to-19-fold higher in milk than in blood, after oral exposure of lactating rats to a dose of 5 mg/kg.  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women should be advised against breast-feeding while receiving IRESSA therapy.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        IRESSA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients as safety and effectiveness have not been established (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Special Populations-Pediatric).<BR>                        In clinical trials of IRESSA alone or with radiation in pediatric patients with primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors, cases of CNS hemorrhage and death have been reported.
