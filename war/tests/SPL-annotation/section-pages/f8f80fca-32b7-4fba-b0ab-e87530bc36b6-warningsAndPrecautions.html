Pooled<BR>analyses of short–term (6 to 18 weeks) placebo–controlled trials<BR>of STRATTERA in<BR>children and adolescents have revealed a greater risk of suicidal ideation<BR>early during treatment in those receiving STRATTERA.<BR>There were a total of 12 trials (11 in ADHD and 1 in enuresis) involving over<BR>2200 patients (including 1357 patients receiving STRATTERA and<BR>851 receiving placebo). The average risk of suicidal ideation in patients<BR>receiving STRATTERA was<BR>0.4% (5/1357 patients), compared to none in placebo–treated patients.<BR>There was 1 suicide attempt among these approximately 2200 patients, occurring<BR>in a patient treated with STRATTERA. No suicides occurred in these<BR>trials. All reactions occurred in children 12 years of age or younger.<BR>All reactions occurred during the first month of treatment. It is unknown<BR>whether the risk of suicidal ideation in pediatric patients extends to longer–term<BR>use. A similar analysis in adult patients treated with STRATTERA for<BR>either ADHD or major depressive disorder (MDD) did not reveal an increased<BR>risk of suicidal ideation or behavior in association with the use of STRATTERA.<BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              All<BR>pediatric patients being treated with STRATTERA should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual<BR>changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                        The following symptoms have been reported with STRATTERA:<BR>anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness,<BR>impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania and mania. Although<BR>a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and the emergence of<BR>suicidal impulses has not been established, there is a concern that such symptoms<BR>may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Thus, patients being treated<BR>with STRATTERA should<BR>be observed for the emergence of such symptoms.<BR>                        Consideration should be given to changing the<BR>therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients<BR>who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors<BR>to emerging suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe or abrupt<BR>in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.<BR>                        <BR>                           Families<BR>and caregivers of pediatric patients being treated with STRATTERA should<BR>be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation,<BR>irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described<BR>above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms<BR>immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily<BR>observation by families and caregivers.<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.2  Severe Liver Injury<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Postmarketing reports indicate that STRATTERA can<BR>cause severe liver injury. Although no evidence of liver injury<BR>was detected in clinical trials of about 6000 patients, there have been rare<BR>cases of clinically significant liver injury that were considered probably<BR>or possibly related to STRATTERA use<BR>in postmarketing experience. Because of probable underreporting, it is impossible<BR>to provide an accurate estimate of the true incidence of these reactions.<BR> Reported cases of liver injury occurred within 120 days of initiation of atomoxetine in the majority of cases and some patients presented with markedly elevated liver enzymes [>20 X upper limit of normal (ULN)], and jaundice with significantly elevated bilirubin levels (>2 X ULN), followed by recovery upon atomoxetine discontinuation.<BR>In one patient, liver injury, manifested by elevated hepatic enzymes up to<BR>40 X upper limit of normal ULN and jaundice with bilirubin up to 12 X ULN, recurred upon rechallenge, and was followed<BR>by recovery upon drug discontinuation, providing evidence that STRATTERA likely<BR>caused the liver injury. Such reactions may occur several months after therapy<BR>is started, but laboratory abnormalities may continue to worsen for several<BR>weeks after drug is stopped. The patient described above recovered from his<BR>liver injury, and did not require a liver transplant. However, severe liver<BR>injury due to any drug may potentially progress to acute liver failure resulting<BR>in death or the need for a liver transplant.<BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                           STRATTERA should<BR>be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver<BR>injury, and should not be restarted.

If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible<BR>causal role of atomoxetine, and discontinuation of treatment should be considered. In a pooled analysis<BR>of multiple short–term, placebo–controlled studies, such symptoms occurred in about 0.2% (4 patients with reactions out of 1939 exposed to atomoxetine for several weeks at usual doses) of atomoxetine–treated patients compared to 0 out of 1056 placebo–treated patients.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.6  Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder<BR>                     <BR>                        In general, particular care should be taken in<BR>treating ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern<BR>for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar<BR>disorder.
