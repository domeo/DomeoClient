Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient.

Therefore reduced doses of cyclosporine should be used in combination with Zortress in order to reduce renal dysfunction. It is important to monitor the cyclosporine and everolimus whole blood trough concentrations.Â [See Dosage and Administration (2.2 and 2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.7 and 12.8)]<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Mortality in Heart Transplantation <BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Increased mortality, often associated with serious infections, within the first three months post-transplantation was observed in a clinical trial of de novo heart transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens with or without induction therapy.
