DOSE APPEARS TO BE AN IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF SEIZURE, WITH A GREATER LIKELIHOOD AT HIGHER CLOZAPINE DOSES. CAUTION SHOULD BE USED WHEN ADMINISTERING CLOZAPINE TO PATIENTS HAVING A HISTORY OF SEIZURES OR OTHER PREDISPOSING FACTORS.

RARELY, COLLAPSE CAN BE PROFOUND AND BE ACCOMPANIED BY RESPIRATORY AND/OR CARDIAC ARREST. ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR DURING INITIAL TITRATION IN ASSOCIATION WITH RAPID DOSE ESCALATION. IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD EVEN A BRIEF INTERVAL OFF CLOZAPINE, i.e., 2 OR MORE DAYS SINCE THE LAST DOSE, TREATMENT SHOULD BE STARTED WITH 12.5 mg ONCE OR TWICE DAILY.

ALTHOUGH THE CAUSES OF DEATH WERE VARIED, MOST OF THE DEATHS APPEARED TO BE EITHER CARDIOVASCULAR (e.g., HEART FAILURE, <BR>                     SUDDEN DEATH) OR INFECTIOUS (e.g., PNEUMONIA) IN NATURE. OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES SUGGEST THAT, SIMILAR TO ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS, TREATMENT WITH CONVENTIONAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS MAY INCREASE MORTALITY. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FINDINGS OF INCREASED MORTALITY IN OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG AS OPPOSED TO SOME CHARACTERISTIC(S) OF THE PATIENTS IS NOT CLEAR.
