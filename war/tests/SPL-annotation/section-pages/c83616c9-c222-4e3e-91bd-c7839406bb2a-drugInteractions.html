KAPIDEX is <BR>likely to substantially decrease the systemic concentrations of the HIV protease <BR>inhibitor atazanavir, which is dependent upon the presence of gastric acid for <BR>absorption, and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect of atazanavir and the <BR>development of HIV resistance. Therefore, KAPIDEX should not be co-administered <BR>with atazanavir. <BR>                  It is theoretically possible that KAPIDEX may interfere with the absorption <BR>of other drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of oral <BR>bioavailability (e.g., ampicillin esters, digoxin, iron salts, <BR>ketoconazole).<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                  7.2 WarfarinCo-administration of KAPIDEX 90 mg and warfarin 25 mg did not <BR>affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin or INR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)]. However, there have been <BR>reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs and <BR>warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to <BR>abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with KAPIDEX and warfarin <BR>concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin <BR>time.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
