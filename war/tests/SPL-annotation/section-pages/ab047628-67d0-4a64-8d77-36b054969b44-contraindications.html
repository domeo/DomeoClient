Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If warfarin sodium is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see <BR>                     <BR>                        Warnings and Precautions (5.6)<BR>                     <BR>                      and <BR>                     <BR>                        Use in Specific Populations (8.1)<BR>                     <BR>                     ].<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        •Hemorrhagic tendencies or blood dyscrasias<BR>                     <BR>                        •Recent or contemplated surgery of the central nervous system or eye, or traumatic surgery resulting in large open surfaces [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)<BR>                        ]<BR>                     <BR>                        •Bleeding tendencies associated with:<BR>                           <BR>                              ∘Active ulceration or overt bleeding of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or respiratory tract<BR>                           <BR>                              ∘Central nervous system hemorrhage<BR>                           <BR>                              ∘Cerebral aneurysms, dissecting aorta<BR>                           <BR>                              ∘Pericarditis and pericardial effusions<BR>                           <BR>                              ∘Bacterial endocarditis<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        •Threatened abortion, eclampsia, and preeclampsia<BR>                     <BR>                        •Unsupervised patients with conditions associated with potential high level of non-compliance<BR>                     <BR>                        •Spinal puncture and other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential for uncontrollable bleeding<BR>                     <BR>                        •Hypersensitivity to warfarin or to any other components of this product (e.g., anaphylaxis) [see <BR>                           Adverse Reactions (6)<BR>                        ]<BR>                     <BR>                        •Major regional or lumbar block anesthesia<BR>                     <BR>                        •Malignant hypertension<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              •Pregnancy, except in women with mechanical heart valves (4)<BR>                           <BR>                              •Hemorrhagic tendencies or blood dyscrasias (4)<BR>                           <BR>                              •Recent or contemplated surgery of the central nervous system (CNS) or eye, or traumatic surgery resulting in large open surfaces (4, 5.7)<BR>                           <BR>                              •Bleeding tendencies associated with certain conditions (4)<BR>                           <BR>                              •Threatened abortion, eclampsia, and preeclampsia (4)<BR>                           <BR>                              •Unsupervised patients with potential high levels of non-compliance (4)<BR>                           <BR>                              •Spinal puncture and other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential for uncontrollable bleeding (4)<BR>                           <BR>                              •Hypersensitivity to warfarin or any component of the product (4)<BR>                           <BR>                              •Major regional or lumbar block anesthesia (4)<BR>                           <BR>                              •Malignant hypertension (4)<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
