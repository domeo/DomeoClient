Following a single 600 mg oral dose of rifampin in<BR>              healthy adults, the peak serum level averages 7 mcg/mL but may vary from 4 to 32<BR>              mcg/mL. Absorption of rifampin is reduced when the drug is ingested with food.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              In normal subjects, the biological half-life of rifampin in serum averages about<BR>              3 hours after a 600 mg oral dose, with increases up to 5.1 hours reported after<BR>              a 900 mg dose. With repeated administration, the half-life decreases and reaches<BR>              average values of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The half-life does not differ in<BR>              patients with renal failure at doses not exceeding 600 mg daily and,<BR>              consequently, no dosage adjustment is required. The half-life of rifampin at a<BR>              dose of 720 mg daily has not been established in patients with renal failure.<BR>              Following a single 900 mg oral dose of rifampin in patients with varying degrees<BR>              of renal insufficiency, the half-life increased from 3.6 hours in normal<BR>              subjects to 5.0, 7.3, and 11.0 hours in patients with glomerular filtration<BR>              rates of 30–50 mL min, less than 30 mL/min, and in anuric patients,<BR>              respectively. Refer to the WARNINGS section for<BR>              information regarding patients with hepatic insufficiency.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              After absorption, rifampin is rapidly eliminated in the bile, and an<BR>              enterohepatic circulation ensues. During this process, rifampin undergoes<BR>              progressive deacetylation so that nearly all the drug in the bile is in this<BR>              form in about 6 hours. This metabolite has antibacterial activity. Intestinal<BR>              reabsorption is reduced by deacetylation, and elimination is facilitated. Up to<BR>              30percent of a dose is excreted in the urine, with about half as unchanged drug.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Rifampin is widely distributed throughout the body. It is present in<BR>              effective concentrations in many organs and body fluids, including cerebrospinal<BR>              fluid. Rifampin is about 80% protein bound. Most of the unbound fraction is not<BR>              ionized and therefore is diffused freely in tissues.<BR>            <BR>                  Isoniazid<BR>              After oral administration, isoniazid is readily absorbed from the<BR>              GI tract and produces peak blood levels within 1 to 2 hours. It diffuses readily<BR>              into all body fluids (cerebrospinal, pleural, and ascitic fluids), tissues,<BR>              organs, and excreta (saliva, sputum, and feces). Isoniazid is not substantially<BR>              bound to plasma proteins. The drug also passes through the placental barrier and<BR>              into milk in concentrations comparable to those in the plasma. The plasma<BR>              half-life of isoniazid in patients with normal renal and hepatic function ranges<BR>              from 1–4 hours, depending on the rate of metabolism. From 50percent to 70percent of a dose<BR>              of isoniazid is excreted in the urine within 24 hours, mostly as<BR>              metabolites.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Isoniazid is metabolized in the liver mainly by acetylation and<BR>              dehydrazination. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined.<BR>              Approximately 50percent of African Americans and Caucasians are "slow inactivators"<BR>              and the rest are "rapid inactivators"; the majority of Eskimos and Asians are<BR>              "rapid inactivators." The rate of acetylation does not significantly alter the<BR>              effectiveness of isoniazid. However, slow acetylation may lead to higher blood<BR>              levels of the drug, and thus, an increase in toxic reactions.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Pyridoxine (B6) deficiency is sometimes observed in<BR>              adults with high doses of isoniazid and is probably due to its competition with<BR>              pyridoxal phosphate for the enzyme apotryptophanase.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>                  Pyrazinamide<BR>              Pyrazinamide is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and<BR>              attains peak plasma concentrations within 2 hours. Plasma concentrations<BR>              generally range from 30 to 50 mcg mL with doses of 20 to 25 mg kg. It is widely<BR>              distributed in body tissues and fluids including the liver, lungs, and<BR>              cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF concentration is approximately equal to<BR>              concurrent steady-state plasma concentrations in patients with inflamed<BR>              meninges. Pyrazinamide is approximately 10percent bound to plasma proteins. The plasma<BR>              half-life of pyrazinamide is 9 to 10 hours in patients with normal renal and<BR>              hepatic function. The half-life of the drug may be prolonged in patients with<BR>              impaired renal or hepatic function. Pyrazinamide is hydrolyzed in the liver to<BR>              its major active metabolite, pyrazinoic acid. Pyrazinoic acid is hydroxylated to<BR>              the main excretory product, 5-hydroxypyrazinoic acid.<BR>            <BR>                  <BR>              Within 24 hours, approximately 70percent of an oral dose of pyrazinamide is<BR>              excreted in urine, mainly by glomerular filtration. About 4percent to 14percent of the dose<BR>              is excreted as unchanged drug; the remainder is excreted as metabolites.<BR>            <BR>                  RIFATER<BR>              In a single-dose bioavailability study of five RIFATER tablets<BR>              (Treatment A, n=23) versus RIFADIN 600 mg, isoniazid 250 mg, and pyrazinamide<BR>              1500 mg (Treatment B, n=24) administered concurrently in normal subjects, there<BR>              was no difference in extent of absorption, as measured by the area under the<BR>              plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), of all three components. However,<BR>              the mean peak plasma concentration of rifampin was approximately 18percent lower<BR>              following the single-dose administration of RIFATER tablets as compared to<BR>              RIFADIN<BR>            <BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
