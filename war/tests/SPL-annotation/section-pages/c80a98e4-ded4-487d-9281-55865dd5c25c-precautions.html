This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given <BR>with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or <BR>conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. <BR>Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or <BR>methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, <BR>nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and <BR>8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. <BR>                  Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. <BR>Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When <BR>feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; <BR>if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality <BR>is established. <BR>                  <BR><BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
