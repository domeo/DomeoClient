The double-blind treatment duration was at least 48 weeks. Trial participants had a mean age of 37 years; were male (81%), Caucasian (54%), black (27%), and American Hispanic (15%). The median baseline CD4+ cell count was 262 cells/mm3 (range: 21 to 918 cells/mm3) and the median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.89 log10 copies/mL (range: 2.60 to 6.99 log10 copies/mL).<BR>                  The outcomes of randomized treatment are provided in Table 4.<BR>                  <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ID="_Refid_40093140-2276-476d-a0a1-de9f391fc"><BR>                     <caption>Table 4.
