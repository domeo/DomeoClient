Fluoxetine was shown <BR>to be significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the Hamilton <BR>Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Fluoxetine was also significantly more <BR>effective than placebo on the HAM-D subscores for depressed mood, sleep <BR>disturbance and the anxiety subfactor. <BR>                        Two 6-week controlled studies (N = 671, randomized) comparing fluoxetine 20 <BR>mg and placebo have shown fluoxetine 20 mg daily to be effective in the <BR>treatment of elderly patients (> 60 years of age) with major depressive <BR>disorder. In these studies, fluoxetine produced a significantly higher rate of <BR>response and remission as defined, respectively, by a 50% decrease in the HAM-D <BR>score and a total endpoint HAM-D score of < 8. Fluoxetine was well tolerated and <BR>the rate of treatment discontinuations due to adverse reactions did not differ <BR>between fluoxetine (12%) and placebo (9%). <BR>                        A study was conducted involving depressed outpatients who had responded <BR>(modified HAMD-17 score of < 7 during each of the last 3 weeks of open-label <BR>treatment and absence of major depressive disorder by DSM-III-R criteria) by the <BR>end of an initial 12-week open-treatment phase on fluoxetine 20 mg/day. These <BR>patients (N = 298) were randomized to continuation on double-blind fluoxetine 20 <BR>mg/day or placebo. At 38 weeks (50 weeks total), a statistically significantly <BR>lower relapse rate (defined as symptoms sufficient to meet a diagnosis of major <BR>depressive disorder for 2 weeks or a modified HAMD-17 score of >14 for 3 weeks) <BR>was observed for patients taking fluoxetine compared with those on placebo. <BR><BR>                        <BR>                        <BR>                        Pediatric (children and adolescents)The efficacy of fluoxetine 20 mg/day in children and adolescents <BR>(N = 315 randomized; 170 children ages 8 to < 13, 145 adolescents ages 13 to < 18) was studied in two 8- to 9-week placebo-controlled clinical trials in <BR>depressed outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III-R <BR>or DSM-IV category of major depressive disorder. <BR>                        In both studies independently, fluoxetine produced a statistically <BR>significantly greater mean change on the Childhood Depression Rating <BR>Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score from baseline to endpoint than did placebo. <BR><BR>                        Subgroup analyses on the CDRS-R total score did not suggest any differential <BR>responsiveness on the basis of age or gender. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     14.2 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder<BR>                     <BR>                        AdultThe effectiveness of fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive <BR>compulsive disorder (OCD) was demonstrated in two 13-week, multicenter, parallel <BR>group studies (Studies 1 and 2) of adult outpatients who received fixed <BR>fluoxetine doses of 20, 40 or 60 mg/day (on a once-a-day schedule, in the <BR>morning) or placebo. Patients in both studies had moderate to severe OCD <BR>(DSM-III-R), with mean baseline ratings on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive <BR>Scale (YBOCS, total score) ranging from 22 to 26. In Study 1, patients receiving <BR>fluoxetine experienced mean reductions of approximately 4 to 6 units on the <BR>YBOCS total score, compared with a 1-unit reduction for placebo patients. In <BR>Study 2, patients receiving fluoxetine experienced mean reductions of <BR>approximately 4 to 9 units on the YBOCS total score, compared with a 1-unit <BR>reduction for placebo patients. While there was no indication of a dose-response <BR>relationship for effectiveness in Study 1, a dose-response relationship was <BR>observed in Study 2, with numerically better responses in the two higher dose <BR>groups.

Patients in the <BR>8-week studies received either 20 or 60 mg/day of fluoxetine or placebo in the <BR>morning. Patients in the 16-week study received a fixed fluoxetine dose of 60 <BR>mg/day (once a day) or placebo. Patients in these three studies had moderate to <BR>severe bulimia with median binge-eating and vomiting frequencies ranging from 7 <BR>to 10 per week and 5 to 9 per week, respectively. In these three studies, <BR>fluoxetine 60 mg, but not 20 mg, was statistically significantly superior to <BR>placebo in reducing the number of binge-eating and vomiting episodes per week. <BR>The statistically significantly superior effect of 60 mg vs. placebo was present <BR>as early as Week 1 and persisted throughout each study. The fluoxetine-related <BR>reduction in bulimic episodes appeared to be independent of baseline depression <BR>as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. In each of these three <BR>studies, the treatment effect, as measured by differences between fluoxetine 60 <BR>mg and placebo on median reduction from baseline in frequency of bulimic <BR>behaviors at endpoint, ranged from 1 to 2 episodes per week for binge-eating and <BR>2 to 4 episodes per week for vomiting. The size of the effect was related to <BR>baseline frequency, with greater reductions seen in patients with higher <BR>baseline frequencies. Although some patients achieved freedom from binge-eating <BR>and purging as a result of treatment, for the majority, the benefit was a <BR>partial reduction in the frequency of binge-eating and purging. <BR>                        In a longer term trial, 150 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bulimia <BR>nervosa, purging subtype, who had responded during a single-blind, 8-week acute <BR>treatment phase with fluoxetine 60 mg/day, were randomized to continuation of <BR>fluoxetine 60 mg/day or placebo, for up to 52 weeks of observation for relapse. <BR>Response during the single-blind phase was defined by having achieved at least a <BR>50% decrease in vomiting frequency compared with baseline. Relapse during the <BR>double-blind phase was defined as a persistent return to baseline vomiting <BR>frequency or physician judgment that the patient had relapsed. Patients <BR>receiving continued fluoxetine 60 mg/day experienced a significantly longer time <BR>to relapse over the subsequent 52 weeks compared with those receiving placebo. <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     14.4 Panic Disorder<BR>                     <BR>                        The effectiveness of fluoxetine in the treatment of panic <BR>disorder was demonstrated in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, <BR>multicenter studies of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of panic <BR>disorder (DSM-IV), with or without agoraphobia.<BR>                        Study 1 (N = 180 randomized) was a 12-week flexible-dose study.
