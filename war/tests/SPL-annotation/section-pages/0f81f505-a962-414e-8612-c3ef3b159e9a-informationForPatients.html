There is an extremely high risk that a deformed baby will result if you become pregnant while taking tretinoin, in any amount, for even short periods of time. Potentially any exposed fetuses can be affected. There is also an increased risk of miscarriage. Premature births may also occur. <BR>                  Effective contraception (birth control) should be discussed with your doctor. Two forms of reliable contraception must be used during therapy, and must be continued for one month after tretinoin treatment has stopped. If directed by your doctor, two forms of reliable contraception must also be used simultaneously for at least one month before beginning therapy. It is recommended that you either abstain from sexual intercourse or use two reliable kinds of birth control at the same time. Birth control must be used even if you think you cannot become pregnant, unless you have had a hysterectomy. <BR>                  If you are pregnant or become pregnant while on tretinoin therapy or during the month after treatment has stopped, immediately contact your doctor to discuss the desirability of continuing the pregnancy. <BR>                  YOU MUST NOT TAKE TRETINOIN IF YOU ARE A NURSING MOTHER.<BR>                  Tretinoin should not be taken by nursing mothers since it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from tretinoin, mothers should discontinue nursing prior to taking this drug. <BR>                  <BR>                     General guidelines for taking your medication...<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     Call your doctor if you have any questions or experience any severe or troubling symptoms. <BR>                     Tretinoin does not need to be refrigerated. However, do not expose the capsules to sunlight or excessive heat. <BR>                     Be sure to take your medication as prescribed by your doctor. Read the prescription label on the package carefully. If there is anything you don’t understand, ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain it to you. <BR>                     Keep tretinoin and all medications out of the reach of children.<BR>                  <BR>                  Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F).<BR>                  <BR>                     PROTECT FROM LIGHT<BR>                  <BR>                  <BR>                     TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA<BR>                  <BR>                  Sellersville, PA 18960<BR>                  Rev.
