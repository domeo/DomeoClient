Do not routinely withdraw chronic beta-blocker therapy prior to surgery. (5.5, 6.1) <BR>                           Diabetes and Hypoglycemia: May mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia (5.6) <BR>                           Patients with Hepatic Impairment: (5.7) <BR>                           Thyrotoxicosis: Abrupt withdrawal in patients with thyrotoxicosis might precipitate a thyroid storm (5.8) <BR>                           Anaphylactic Reactions: Patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction (5.9) <BR>                           Peripheral Vascular Disease: Can aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency (5.10)<BR>                           Calcium Channel Blockers: Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly (5.11). <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        5.1<BR>                         Ischemic Heart Disease<BR>                         <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol succinate extended-release, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 - 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate metoprolol succinate extended-release, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician’s advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol succinate extended-release in patients treated only for hypertension.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        5.2<BR>                         Heart Failure<BR>                         <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of metoprolol succinate extended-release. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Dosage and Administration (2)<BR>                           <BR>                           ]. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of metoprolol succinate extended-release.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        5.3<BR>                         Bronchospastic Disease<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD, IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Because of its relative beta1 cardio-selectivity, however, metoprolol succinate extended-release may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Dosage and Administration (2)<BR>                           <BR>                           ].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        5.4<BR>                         Pheochromocytoma<BR>                         <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        If metoprolol succinate extended-release is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        5.5<BR>                         Major Surgery<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Avoid initiation of a high-dose regimen of extended release metoprolol in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, since such use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, stroke and death.<BR>                        Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        5.6<BR>                         Diabetes and Hypoglycemia<BR>                         <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Beta-blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        5.7<BR>                         Hepatic Impairment<BR>                         <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Consider initiating metoprolol succinate extended-release therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication; gradually increase dosage to optimize therapy, while monitoring closely for adverse events. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        5.8<BR>                         Thyrotoxicosis<BR>                         <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia.
