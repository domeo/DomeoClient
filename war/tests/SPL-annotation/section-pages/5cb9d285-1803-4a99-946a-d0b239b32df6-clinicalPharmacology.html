In aqueous media, busulfan hydrolyzes to release the methanesulfonate groups.  This produces reactive carbonium ions that can alkylate DNA. DNA damage is thought to be responsible for much of the cytotoxicity of busulfan.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Pharmacokinetics<BR>                     <BR>                        The pharmacokinetics of BUSULFEX were studied in 59 patients participating in a prospective trial of a BUSULFEX-cyclophosphamide preparatory regimen prior to allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor stem cell transplantation.  Patients received 0.8 mg/kg BUSULFEX every six hours, for a total of 16 doses over four days.  Fifty-five of fifty-nine patients (93%) administered BUSULFEX maintained AUC values below the target value (<1500 µM∙min).<BR>                        <BR><BR><table xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" width="85%"><BR>                           <caption>Table 1: Steady State Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Busulfex<sup>&#174;</sup> (busulfan) Infusion (0.8&#160;mg/kg; N=59)</caption><BR>                           <col width="40%" align="left" valign="top"/><BR>                           <col width="20%" align="center" valign="top"/><BR>                           <col width="20%" align="center" valign="top"/><BR>                           <col width="20%" align="center" valign="top"/><BR>                           <thead><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Lrule"/><BR>                                 <th>Mean</th><BR>                                 <th>CV (%)</th><BR>                                 <th styleCode="Rrule">Range</th><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </thead><BR>                           <tbody><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule">C<sub>max</sub> (ng/mL)</td><BR>                                 <td>1222</td><BR>                                 <td>18</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Rrule">496-1684</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr styleCode="Botrule"><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule">AUC&#160;(&#181;M&#8729;min)</td><BR>                                 <td>1167</td><BR>                                 <td>20</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Rrule">556-1673</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                              <tr><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Lrule">CL (mL/min/kg)<footnote>Clearance normalized to actual body weight for all patients.</footnote><BR>                                 </td><BR>                                 <td>2.52</td><BR>                                 <td>25</td><BR>                                 <td styleCode="Rrule">1.49-4.31</td><BR>                              </tr><BR>                           </tbody><BR>                        </table><BR>                        <BR><BR><BR>BUSULFEX pharmacokinetics showed consistency between dose 9 and dose 13 as demonstrated by reproducibility of steady state Cmax and a low coefficient of variation for this parameter.<BR>                        In a pharmacokinetic study of BUSULFEX in 24 pediatric patients, the population pharmacokinetic (PPK) estimates of BUSULFEX for clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V) were determined.

The incomplete recovery of radioactivity may be due to the formation of long-lived metabolites or due to nonspecific alkylation of macromolecules.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
