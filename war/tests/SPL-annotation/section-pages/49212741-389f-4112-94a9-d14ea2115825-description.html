Each scored tablet contains 50 mg azathioprine USP and the inactive ingredients anhydrous lactose, magnesium stearate, povidone, pregelatinized starch (corn starch), and stearic acid. <BR>                  It is an imidazolyl derivative of 6-mercaptopurine and many of its biological effects are similar to those of the parent compound. Azathioprine is insoluble in water, but may be dissolved with addition of one molar equivalent of alkali. The sodium salt of azathioprine is sufficiently soluble to make a 10 mg/mL water solution which is stable for 24 hours at 59째 to 77째F (15째 to 25째C). Azathioprine is stable in solution at neutral or acid pH but hydrolysis to mercaptopurine occurs in excess sodium hydroxide (0.1N), especially on warming. Conversion to mercaptopurine also occurs in the presence of sulfhydryl compounds such as cysteine, glutathione and hydrogen sulfide.<BR>                  Azathioprine is chemically 1H-Purine, 6-[(1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazol-5-yl)thio]-. The structural formula of azathioprine is:<BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     structural formula<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
