Expected changes in laboratory assessments of PT and INR were observed after warfarin administration, but these changes were not affected by concomitant REVLIMID administration. It is not known whether there is an interaction between dexamethasone and warfarin. Close monitoring of PT and INR is recommended in multiple myeloma patients taking concomitant warfarin. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     7.3		Concomitant Therapies That May Increase the Risk of Thrombosis <BR>                     <BR>                        Erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as estrogen containing therapies, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide with dexamethasone.
