As some hormonal contraceptives are metabolized by CYP3A4, their effectiveness may be diminished when given with ONFI. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended when using ONFI [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Patient Counseling Information (17)].<BR>                        <BR>                           Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6<BR>                        <BR>                        ONFI inhibits CYP2D6. Dose adjustment of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 may be necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on ONFI<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19<BR>                        <BR>                        Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 may result in increased exposure to N-desmethylclobazam, the active metabolite of clobazam. This may increase the risk of dose-related adverse reactions. Dosage adjustment of ONFI may be necessary when coadministered with strong CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, fluvoxamine, ticlopidine) or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>7.3 CNS Depressants and Alcohol<BR><BR>                     <BR>                        Concomitant use of ONFI with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].<BR>                        Alcohol, as a CNS depressant, will interact with ONFI in a similar way and also increases clobazam's maximum plasma exposure by approximately 50%. Therefore, caution patients or their caregivers against simultaneous use with other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol, and cautioned that the effects of other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol may be potentiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
