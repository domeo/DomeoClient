                 Fluorouracil Injection, USP should be administered only intravenously, using care to avoid extravasation.  No dilution is required.  All dosages are based on the patient’s actual weight.  However, the estimated lean body mass (dry weight) is used if the patient is obese or if there has been a spurious weight gain due to edema, ascites or other forms of abnormal fluid retention.<BR>                        It is recommended that prior to treatment each patient be carefully evaluated in order to estimate as accurately as possible the optimum initial dosage of Fluorouracil.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>

account in determining the amount of the drug to be used, and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly.  Some patients have received from 9 to 45 courses of treatment during periods which ranged from 12 to 60 months.<BR>                        Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered.  Several guidelines on this subject have been published.2-7  There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>

should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.  Although the Fluorouracil solution may discolor slightly during storage, the potency and safety are not adversely affected.  If a precipitate occurs due to exposure to low temperatures, resolubilize by heating to 140°F and shaking vigorously; allow to cool to body temperature before using.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
