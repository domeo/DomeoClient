XENAZINE should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.<BR>                              Tetrabenazine had no clear effects on embryo-fetal development when administered to pregnant rats throughout the period of organogenesis at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (or 3 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 100 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis). Tetrabenazine had no effects on embryo-fetal development when administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (or 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).  Because neither rat nor rabbit dosed with tetrabenazine produce 9-desmethyl-beta-DHTBZ, a major human metabolite, these studies may not have adequately addressed the potential effects of tetrabenazine on embryo-fetal development in humans.<BR>                              When tetrabenazine was administered to female rats (doses of 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day) from the beginning of organogenesis through the lactation period, an increase in stillbirths and offspring postnatal mortality was observed at 15 and 30 mg/kg/day and delayed pup maturation was observed at all doses. The no-effect dose for stillbirths and postnatal mortality was 0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis.  Because rats dosed with tetrabenazine do not produce 9-desmethyl-beta-DHTBZ, a major human metabolite, this study may not have adequately assessed the potential effects of tetrabenazine on the offspring of women exposed in utero and via lactation.<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.2   Labor and Delivery<BR>                     <BR>                        The effect of XENAZINE on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3   Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        It is not known whether XENAZINE or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. <BR>                        Since many drugs are excreted into human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from XENAZINE, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue XENAZINE, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4   Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        The safety and efficacy of XENAZINE in children have not been established.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5   Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        The pharmacokinetics of XENAZINE and its primary metabolites have not been formally studied in geriatric subjects. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.6    Use in Patients with Hepatic Disease<BR>                     <BR>                        The use of XENAZINE in patients with liver disease is contraindicated [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Dosage and Administration (2.4), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.16), and <BR>                           <BR>                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.7    Use in Patients with Depression and Suicidality<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients with HD are at increased risk for depression, suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality), and XENAZINE increases these risks.  XENAZINE is contraindicated in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression or who are actively suicidal.  XENAZINE may increase the risk for depression or suicidality in patients with a history of depression or suicidal behavior or in patients with diseases, conditions, or treatments that cause depression or suicidality [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Depression<BR>                              <BR>                              Symptoms of sadness, worsening of depression, withdrawal, insomnia, irritability, hostility (aggressiveness), akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), anxiety, agitation, or panic attacks may increase with XENAZINE.

The dose of XENAZINE should then be individualized accordingly to their status as either poor (PMs) or extensive metabolizers (EMs) [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, <BR>                              5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Poor Metabolizers<BR>                              <BR>                              Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers (PM) will have substantially higher levels of exposure to the primary metabolites (about 3-fold for α-HTBZ and 9-fold for β-HTBZ) compared to EMs. The dosage should, therefore, be adjusted according to a patient's CYP2D6 metabolizer status by limiting a single dose to a maximum of 25 mg and the recommended daily dose to not exceed a maximum of 50 mg/day in patients who are CYP2D6 PMs [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, <BR>                                    5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>											<BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              <BR>                                 Extensive/Intermediate Metabolizers    <BR>                              <BR>                              In extensive (EMs) or intermediate metabolizers (IMs), the dosage of XENAZINE can be titrated to a maximum single dose of 37.5 mg and a recommended maximum daily dose of 100 mg [see <BR>                                 <BR>                                    Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interaction (7.1), and <BR>                                 <BR>                                    Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].<BR>                              <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.9    Use in Patients at Risk from QTc Prolongation<BR>                     <BR>                        XENAZINE causes a small increase in QTc interval (8 msec).
