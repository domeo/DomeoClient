These symptoms may also be accompanied by diarrhea, rash, fever, malaise, myalgias, elevations in liver enzymes, and occasionally, hypotension. Symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity most often develop within the first several weeks of therapy with azathioprine tablets and are reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. The reaction can recur within hours after rechallenge with a single dose of azathioprine tablets.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Information for Patients<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients being started on azathioprine tablets should be informed of the necessity of periodic blood counts while they are receiving the drug and should be encouraged to report any unusual bleeding or bruising to their physician. They should be informed of the danger of infection while receiving azathioprine tablets  and asked to report signs and symptoms of infection to their physician. Careful dosage instructions should be given to the patient, especially when azathioprine tablets are being administered in the presence of impaired renal function or concomitantly with allopurinol (see <BR>                              Drug Interactions<BR>                           subsection and <BR>                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Patients should be advised of the potential risks of the use of azathioprine tablets during pregnancy and during the nursing period. The increased risk of malignancy following therapy with azathioprine tablets should be explained to the patient.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Laboratory Tests<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Complete Blood Count (CBC) Monitoring <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                        Patients on azathioprine tablets should have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage alterations or other therapy changes are necessary.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     TPMT Testing<BR>                     <BR>                        It is recommended that consideration be given to either genotype or phenotype patients for TPMT. Phenotyping and genotyping methods are commercially available. The most common non-functional alleles associated with reduced levels of TPMT activity are TPMT*2, TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C. Patients with two non-functional alleles (homozygous) have low or absent TPMT activity and those with one non-functional allele (heterozygous) have intermediate activity. Accurate phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) results are not possible in patients who have received recent blood transfusions. TPMT testing may also be considered in patients with abnormal CBC results that do not respond to dose reduction. Early drug discontinuation in these patients is advisable. TPMT TESTING CANNOT SUBSTITUTE FOR COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC) MONITORING IN PATIENTS RECEIVING AZATHIOPRINE TABLETS (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, <BR>                           <BR>                              ADVERSE REACTIONS<BR>                           and <BR>                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION<BR>                           sections).<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Drug Interactions<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Use with <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              Allopurinol<BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                        One of the pathways for inactivation of azathioprine is inhibited by allopurinol. Patients receiving azathioprine tablets and allopurinol concomitantly should have a dose reduction of azathioprine tablets, to approximately ⅓ to ¼ the usual dose. It is recommended that a further dose reduction or alternative therapies be considered for patients with low or absent TPMT activity receiving azathioprine tablets and allopurinol because both TPMT and XO inactivation pathways are affected (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, <BR>                           <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests<BR>                           and <BR>                              ADVERSE REACTIONS<BR>                           sections).<BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Use with <BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                              Aminosalicylates<BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                        There is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (e.g., sulphasalazine, mesalazine, or olsalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme.

Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMDH) is required for one of the metabolic pathways of azathioprine. Ribavirin is known to inhibit IMDH, thereby leading to accumulation of an azathioprine metabolite, 6-methylthioionosine monophosphate (6MTITP), which is associated with myelotoxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia). Patients receiving azathioprine with ribavirin should have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, monitored weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage or other therapy changes are necessary.<BR>                        <BR>                           Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility <BR>                        <BR>                        See WARNINGS section.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Pregnancy:<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           <BR>                              Teratogenic<BR>                           <BR>                           <BR>                               Effects <BR>                           <BR>                        <BR>                        Pregnancy Category D.
