It is <BR>not a central nervous system stimulant nor a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. The <BR>current hypothesis is that the clinical effects are due, at least in part, to <BR>influences on the adrenergic activity at the synapses so that deactivation of <BR>norepinephrine by reuptake into the nerve terminals is prevented. Animal studies <BR>suggest that doxepin does not appreciably antagonize the antihypertensive action <BR>of guanethidine. In animal studies anticholinergic, antiserotonin and <BR>antihistamine effects on smooth muscle have been demonstrated. At higher than <BR>usual clinical doses norepinephrine response was potentiated in animals. This <BR>effect was not demonstrated in humans.<BR>                  At clinical dosages up to 150 mg per day, doxepin can be given to man <BR>concomitantly with guanethidine and related compounds without blocking the <BR>antihypertensive effect. At dosages above 150 mg per day blocking of the <BR>antihypertensive effect of these compounds has been reported.<BR>                  Doxepin is virtually devoid of euphoria as a side effect. Characteristic of <BR>this type of compound, doxepin has not been demonstrated to produce the physical <BR>tolerance or psychological dependence associated with addictive compounds.<BR>               <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
