Fulvestrant caused fetal loss or abnormalities in animals when administered during the period of organogenesis at doses significantly smaller than the maximum recommended human dose based on the body surface area (BSA). Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant while receiving FASLODEX. If FASLODEX is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.<BR>                        In studies in female rats at intramuscular doses ≥ 0.01 mg/kg/day (0.6% of the human recommended dose based on BSA), fulvestrant caused a reversible reduction in female fertility, as well as effects on embryo-fetal development consistent with its antiestrogenic activity. Fulvestrant caused an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities in rats (tarsal flexure of the hind paw at 2 mg/kg/day; equivalent to the human dose based on BSA) and non-ossification of the odontoid and ventral tubercle of the first cervical vertebra at doses ≥ 0.1 mg/kg/day (6% the human dose based on BSA) when administered during the period of organogenesis. Rabbits failed to maintain pregnancy when dosed intramuscularly with 1 mg/kg/day fulvestrant (equivalent to the human dose based on BSA) during the period of organogenesis. Further, in rabbits dosed at 0.25 mg/kg/day (30% the human dose based on BSA), increases in placental weight and post-implantation loss were observed. Fulvestrant was associated with an increased incidence of fetal variations in rabbits (backwards displacement of the pelvic girdle, and 27 pre-sacral vertebrae at 0.25 mg/kg/day; 30% the human dose based on BSA) when administered during the period of organogenesis. Because pregnancy could not be maintained in the rabbit following doses of fulvestrant of 1 mg/kg/day and above, this study was inadequate to fully define the possible adverse effects on fetal development at clinically relevant exposures.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.3 Nursing Mothers<BR>                     <BR>                        It is not known if fulvestrant is excreted in human milk. Fulvestrant is found in rat milk at levels significantly higher (approximately 12-fold) than plasma after administration of 2 mg/kg. Drug exposure in rodent pups from fulvestrant-treated lactating dams was estimated as 10% of the administered dose. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from FASLODEX, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.4 Pediatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        A multi-center, single-arm, open-label, study of fulvestrant was conducted in 30 girls with McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS) associated with progressive precocious puberty (PPP).  The median age at informed consent was 6 years old (range: 1 to 8).    <BR>                        The first 10 patients initially received fulvestrant 2 mg/kg. Based on PK data from the first 6 patients, all 10 patients receiving 2 mg/kg were escalated to a dose of 4 mg/kg and all other patients received 4 mg/kg from study entry.    <BR>                        Baseline measurements for vaginal bleeding days, bone age, growth velocity, and Tanner staging for at least 6 months prior to study entry were provided retrospectively by the parent, guardian or local consultant.  All measurements during the study period were collected prospectively.  Patients’ baseline characteristics included the following: a mean ± SD chronological age of 5.9 ± 1.8 years; a mean rate of bone age advancement (change in bone age in years divided by change in chronological age in years) of 2.0 ± 1.03; and a mean growth velocity z-score of 2.4 ± 3.26.   <BR>                        Twenty-nine of 30 patients completed the 12-month study period.  The following results were observed: 35% (95% CI: 16%, 57%) of the 23 patients with baseline vaginal bleeding experienced a complete cessation of vaginal bleeding on-treatment (month 0 to 12); a reduction in the rate of bone age advancement during the 12-month study period compared to baseline (mean change = -0.9 [95% CI = -1.4, -0.4]); and a reduction in mean growth velocity Z-score on-treatment compared to baseline (mean change = -1.1 [95% CI = -2.7, 0.4]).  There were no clinically meaningful changes in median Tanner stage (breast or pubic), mean uterine volume, or mean ovarian volume, or predicted adult height (PAH) on-treatment compared to baseline.  The effect of Faslodex on bone mineral density in children has not been studied and is not known.  <BR>                        Eight patients (27%) experienced adverse reactions that were considered possibly related to Faslodex.  These included injection site reactions (inflammation, pain, hematoma, pruritis, rash), abdominal pain, contusion, tachycardia, hot flush, extremity pain, and vomiting.  Nine (30.0%) patients reported an SAE, none of which were considered related to Faslodex.  No patients discontinued study treatment due to an AE and no patients died.  <BR>                        Pharmacokinetics  <BR>                        The pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant was characterized using a population pharmacokinetic analysis with sparse samples per patient obtained from 30 female pediatric patients aged 1 to 8 years with PPP associated with MAS.  Pharmacokinetic data from 294 postmenopausal women with breast cancer who received 125 or 250 mg monthly dosing regimen were also included in the analysis.   <BR>                        In these pediatric patients receiving 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of fulvestrant, the geometric mean (SD) CL/F was 444 (165) mL/min which was 32% lower than adults. The geometric mean (SD) steady state trough concentration (Cmin,ss) and AUCss was 4.19 (0. 87) ng/mL and 3680 (1020) ng*hr/mL, respectively.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.5 Geriatric Use<BR>                     <BR>                        For FASLODEX 250 mg, when tumor response was considered by age, objective responses were seen in 22% and 24% of patients under 65 years of age and in 11% and 16% of patients 65 years of age and older, who were treated with FASLODEX in Study 2 and Study 3, respectively.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.6 Hepatic Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        FASLODEX is metabolized primarily in the liver. <BR>                        The pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant were evaluated after a single dose of 100 mg in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function (n = 7 subjects/group), using a shorter-acting intramuscular injection formulation. Subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh class A) had comparable mean AUC and clearance values to those with normal hepatic function. In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) the average AUC of fulvestrant increased by 70% compared to patients with normal hepatic function. AUC was positively correlated with total bilirubin concentration (p = 0.012). FASLODEX has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). <BR>                        A dose of FASLODEX 250 mg is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warning and Precautions (5.2)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     8.7 Renal Impairment<BR>                     <BR>                        Negligible amounts of fulvestrant are eliminated in urine; therefore, a study in patients with renal impairment was not conducted. In the advanced breast cancer trials, fulvestrant concentrations in women with estimated creatinine clearance as low as 30 mL/min were similar to women with normal creatinine.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
