Based on its mechanism of action EXEMESTANE is expected to result in adverse reproductive effects. In non-clinical studies in rats and rabbits, EXEMESTANE was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and abortifacient.<BR>                        EXEMESTANE is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.<BR>                        EXEMESTANE tablets should not be administered to premenopausal women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
