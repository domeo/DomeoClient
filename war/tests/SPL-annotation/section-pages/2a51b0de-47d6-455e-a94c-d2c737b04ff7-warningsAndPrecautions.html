WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS<BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                           Hepatotoxicity: Drug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome has occurred. Monitor monthly and as clinically indicated with more frequent testing in patients with Grade 2â€“4 elevations. Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI as indicated. (5.1) <BR>                           Pneumonitis: Severe, including fatal, treatment-related pneumonitis has been observed. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue in patients diagnosed with treatment-related pneumonitis. (5.2)<BR>                           QT Interval Prolongation: In patients who have a history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation, or who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval, consider periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms and electrolytes. (5.3)<BR>                           ALK Testing: Detection of ALK-positive NSCLC using an FDA-approved test, indicated for this use, is necessary for selection of patients for treatment with XALKORI. (5.4)<BR>                           Pregnancy: XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

These cases have occurred during XALKORI treatment in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials. Concurrent elevations in ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials. Elevation in ALT greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 7% of patients in Study A and in 4% of patients in Study B. These laboratory findings were generally asymptomatic and reversible upon dosing interruption. Patients usually resumed treatment at a lower dose without recurrence; however, 3 patients from Study A (2%) and 1 patient from Study B (less than 1%) required permanent discontinuation from treatment. Transaminase elevations generally occurred within the first 2 months of treatment. Monitor with liver function tests including ALT and total bilirubin once a month and as clinically indicated, with more frequent repeat testing for increased liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin in patients who develop transaminase elevations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.2 Pneumonitis<BR>                     <BR>                        XALKORI has been associated with severe, life-threatening, or fatal treatment-related pneumonitis in clinical trials with a frequency of 4 in 255 (1.6%) patients across Studies A and B. All of these cases occurred within 2 months after the initiation of treatment. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of pneumonitis. Exclude other causes of pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients diagnosed with treatment-related pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].  <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.3 QT Interval Prolongation<BR>                     <BR>                        QTc prolongation has been observed. Avoid use of XALKORI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Consider periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, or who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval. Permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients who develop Grade 4 QTc prolongation. Withhold XALKORI in patients who develop Grade 3 QTc prolongation until recovery to less than or equal to Grade 1, then resume XALKORI at 200 mg twice daily. In case of recurrence of Grade 3 QTc prolongation, withhold XALKORI until recovery to less than or equal to Grade 1, then resume XALKORI at 250 mg once daily. Permanently discontinue XALKORI if Grade 3 QTc prolongation recurs [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     5.4 ALK Testing<BR>                     <BR>                        Detection of ALK-positive NSCLC using an FDA-approved test, indicated for this use, is necessary for selection of patients for treatment with XALKORI [see Clinical Studies (14)]. <BR>                        <BR>                        Assessment for ALK-positive NSCLC should be performed by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency in the specific technology being utilized.

In nonclinical studies in rats, crizotinib was embryotoxic and fetotoxic at exposures similar to and above those observed in humans at the recommended clinical dose of 250 mg twice daily. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using XALKORI. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
