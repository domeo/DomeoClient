Patients and their families should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of suicidal ideation and should report it immediately to the patient's physician [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and Use in Specific  Populations (8.7)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.2	Risk of Depression<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients and their families should be told that XENAZINE may cause depression or may worsen pre-existing depression. They should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of sadness, worsening of depression, withdrawal, insomnia, irritability, hostility (aggressiveness), akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), anxiety, agitation, or panic attacks and should report such symptoms promptly to the patient's physician [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and Use in Specific  Populations (8.7)]. <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.3	Dosing of XENAZINE<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients and their families should be told that the dose of XENAZINE will be titrated up slowly to the dose that is best for each patient. Sedation, akathisia, parkinsonism, depression, and difficulty swallowing may occur.  Such symptoms should be promptly reported to the physician and the XENAZINE dose may need to be reduced or discontinued [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Dosage and Administration (2.2), <BR>                           and Warnings and Precautions (5.3, <BR>                              5.6, <BR>                              5.7, <BR>                              5.9)].<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.4	Risk of Sedation and Somnolence<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients should be told that XENAZINE may induce sedation and somnolence and may impair the ability to perform tasks that require complex motor and mental skills. Patients should be advised that until they learn how they respond to XENAZINE, they should be careful doing activities that require them to be alert, such as driving a car or operating machinery [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.5	Interaction with Alcohol<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients and their families should be advised that alcohol may potentiate the sedation induced by XENAZINE [see <BR>                           <BR>                              Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.6	Usage in Pregnancy<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients and their families should be advised to notify the physician if the patient becomes pregnant or intends to become pregnant during XENAZINE therapy, or is breast-feeding or intending to breast-feed an infant during therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) and <BR>                           <BR>                              Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].<BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     17.7	General Advice<BR>                     <BR>                        Patients and their families should be advised to notify the physician of all medications the patient is taking and to consult with the physician before starting any new medications.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
