Dose increases should usually occur in increments of 20 mg at intervals of no less than one week. Although certain patients may require a dose of 60 mg/day, the only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an advantage for the 60 mg/day dose over the 40 mg/day dose; doses above 40 mg are therefore not ordinarily recommended.<BR>                        Citalopram tablets USP should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Special Populations<BR>                     <BR>                        20 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment, with titration to 40 mg/day only for nonresponding patients.<BR>                        No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Citalopram tablets USP should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester<BR>                     <BR>                        Neonates exposed to citalopram tablets USP and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS<BR>                           ). When treating pregnant women with citalopram tablets USP during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. The physician may consider tapering citalopram tablets USP in the third trimester.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Maintenance Treatment<BR>                     <BR>                        It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Systematic evaluation of citalopram tablets USP in two studies has shown that its antidepressant efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 6 or 8 weeks of initial treatment (32 weeks total). In one study, patients were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of citalopram tablets USP (20-60 mg/day) during maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, while in the other study, patients were assigned randomly to continuation of citalopram tablets USP 20 or 40 mg/day, or placebo, for maintenance treatment. In the latter study, the rates of relapse to depression were similar for the two dose groups (see <BR>                              CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials<BR>                           ).<BR>                        Based on these limited data, it is not known whether the dose of citalopram needed to maintain euthymia is identical to the dose needed to induce remission. If adverse reactions are bothersome, a decrease in dose to 20 mg/day can be considered.<BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram Tablets USP<BR>                     <BR>                        Symptoms associated with discontinuation of citalopram tablets USP and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported (see <BR>                              PRECAUTIONS<BR>                           ). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     <BR>                     <BR>                     Switching Patients To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor<BR>                     <BR>                        At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of citalopram tablets USP therapy.
