DESCRIPTION<BR>               <BR>                  Clopidogrel bisulfate is a thienopyridine class inhibitor of P2Y12 ADP platelet receptors. Chemically it is methyl (+)-(S)-α-(2-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)acetate sulfate (1:1). The empirical formula of clopidogrel bisulfate is C16H16ClNO2S•H2SO4 and its molecular weight is 419.9. <BR>                       The structural formula is as follows: <BR>                  <BR>                  Clopidogrel bisulfate, USP is a white to off-white powder. It is practically insoluble in water at neutral pH but freely soluble at pH 1. It also dissolves freely in methanol, dissolves sparingly in methylene chloride, and is practically insoluble in ethyl ether. It has a specific optical rotation of about +56°.<BR>                  Clopidogrel tablets, USP for oral administration are provided as light pink colored, round, beveled edge, biconvex, film-coated tablets containing 97.875 mg of clopidogrel bisulfate which is the molar equivalent of 75 mg of clopidogrel base. <BR>                  Each tablet contains colloidal silicon dioxide, hydrogenated castor oil, lactose monohydrate, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose and polyethylene glycol 6000 as inactive ingredients. The light pink film coating contains ferric oxide red, hypromellose 2910, and titanium dioxide. <BR>               <BR>               <BR>               <BR>                  <BR>                     str<BR>                     <BR>                        <BR>                     <BR>                  <BR>               <BR>            <BR>         </P></DIV></HTML>
