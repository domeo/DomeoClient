<p class="First"> <span class="Italics">Recommended Dose</span> </p>   <p>The recommended dose of GILENYA is 0.5 mg orally once-daily. Fingolimod doses higher than 0.5 mg are associated with a greater incidence of adverse reactions without additional benefit. GILENYA can be taken with or without food.</p>   <p> <span class="Italics">First Dose Monitoring</span> </p>   <p> Initiation of GILENYA treatment results in a decrease in heart rate <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. After the first dose of GILENYA, the heart rate decrease starts within an hour and the Day 1 nadir generally occurs within approximately 6 hours, although the nadir can be observed up to 24 hours after the first dose in some patients. </p>   <p> The first dose of GILENYA should be administered in a setting in which resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia are available. In order to assess patient response to the first dose of fingolimod, observe all patients for 6 hours for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement. Obtain in all patients an electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to dosing, and at the end of the observation period. </p>   <p> Additional observation should be instituted until the finding has resolved in the following situations: </p>   <ul class="Disc">    <li> The heart rate 6 hours postdose is &lt;45 bpm </li>    <li> The heart rate 6 hours postdose is at the lowest value postdose (suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not have occurred) </li>    <li> The ECG 6 hours postdose shows new onset second degree or higher atrioventricular (AV) block </li>   </ul>   <p> Should postdose symptomatic bradycardia occur, initiate appropriate management, begin continuous ECG monitoring, and continue observation until the symptoms have resolved. </p>   <p> Should a patient require pharmacologic intervention for symptomatic bradycardia, continuous overnight ECG monitoring in a medical facility should be instituted, and the first dose monitoring strategy should be repeated after the second dose of GILENYA. </p>   <p>Patients with some preexisting conditions (e.g., ischemic heart disease, history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, history of symptomatic bradycardia, history of recurrent syncope, severe untreated sleep apnea, AV block, sinoatrial heart block) may poorly tolerate the GILENYA-induced bradycardia, or experience serious rhythm disturbances after the first dose of GILENYA. Prior to treatment with GILENYA, these patients should have a cardiac evaluation by a physician appropriately trained to conduct such evaluation, and, if treated with GILENYA, should be monitored overnight with continuous ECG in a medical facility after the first dose. GILENYA is contraindicated in patients who in the last 6 months experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization or Class III/IV heart failure <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. </p>   <p> Since initiation of GILENYA treatment results in decreased heart rate and may prolong the QT interval, patients with a prolonged QTc interval (&gt;450 msec males, &gt;470 msec females) before dosing or during 6 hour observation, or at additional risk for QT prolongation (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, congenital long-QT syndrome), or on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes (e.g., citalopram, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, methadone, erythromycin) should be monitored overnight with continuous ECG in a medical facility <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. </p>   <p>Experience with GILENYA is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow heart rate or atrioventricular conduction (e.g., beta blockers, heart-rate lowering calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem or verapamil, or digoxin). Because the initiation of GILENYA treatment is also associated with slowing of the heart rate, concomitant use of these drugs during GILENYA initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia or heart block. The possibility to switch to drugs that do not slow the heart rate or atrioventricular conduction should be evaluated by the physician prescribing these drugs before initiating GILENYA. Patients who cannot switch should have overnight continuous ECG monitoring after the first dose <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. </p>   <p> Clinical data indicate effects of GILENYA on heart rate are maximal after the first dose although milder effects on heart rate may persist for, on average, 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy at which time heart rate generally returns to baseline. Physicians should continue to be alert to patient reports of cardiac symptoms. </p>   <p> <span class="Italics">Reinitiation of Therapy Following Discontinuation</span> </p>   <p> If GILENYA therapy is discontinued for more than 14 days, after the first month of treatment, the effects on heart rate and AV conduction may recur on reintroduction of GILENYA treatment and the same precautions (first dose monitoring) as for initial dosing should apply. Within the first 2 weeks of treatment, first dose procedures are recommended after interruption of 1 day or more; during weeks 3 and 4 of treatment first dose procedures are recommended after treatment interruption of more than 7 days. </p>   <span class="close-toggle show-js"><a href="#">Close</a></span> </div></li><li><a href="#">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</a> <div class="Section toggle-content closed" data-sectioncode="43678-2">   <a name="s3"></a>  <a name="section-3"></a>   <p></p>    <p class="First">GILENYA is available as 0.5 mg hard capsules with a white opaque body and bright yellow cap imprinted with “FTY 0.5 mg” on the cap and 2 radial bands imprinted on the capsule body with yellow ink.</p>   <span class="close-toggle show-js"><a href="#">Close</a></span> </div></li><li><a href="#">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTRAINDICATIONS</a> <div class="Section toggle-content closed" data-sectioncode="34070-3">   <a name="s4"></a>  <a name="section-4"></a>   <p></p>    <ul>    <li>Patients who in the last 6 months experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, TIA, decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization or Class III/IV heart failure</li>    <li>History or presence of Mobitz Type II second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block or sick sinus syndrome, unless patient has a functioning pacemaker</li>    <li>Baseline QTc interval ≥500 msec</li>    <li>Treatment with Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs</li>   </ul>   <span class="close-toggle show-js"><a href="#">Close</a></span> </div></li><li><a href="#">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</a> <div class="Section toggle-content closed" data-sectioncode="43685-7">   <a name="section-5"></a>   <p></p>    <div class="Section" data-sectioncode="42229-5">    <a name="s5p1"></a>   <a name="section-5.1"></a>    <p></p>    <h2> 5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bradyarrhythmia and Atrioventricular Blocks </h2>    <p class="First"> Because of a risk for bradyarrhythmia and atrioventricular (AV) blocks, patients should be monitored during GILENYA treatment initiation <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. </p>    <p style="border-left:1px solid;"> <span class="XmChange"><span class="Italics">Reduction in Heart Rate</span></span> </p>    <p style="border-left:1px solid;"> <span class="XmChange">After the first dose of GILENYA, the heart rate decrease starts within an hour. On Day 1, the maximum decline in heart rate generally occurs within 6 hours and recovers, although not to baseline levels, by 8 to 10 hours postdose. Because of physiological diurnal variation, there is a second period of heart rate decrease within 24 hours after the first dose. In some patients, heart rate decrease during the second period is more pronounced than the decrease observed in the first 6 hours. Heart rates below 40 beats per minute were rarely observed. In controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions of symptomatic bradycardia following the first dose were reported in 0.6% of patients receiving GILENYA 0.5 mg and in 0.1% of patients on placebo. Patients who experienced bradycardia were generally asymptomatic, but some patients experienced hypotension, dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, and/or chest pain that usually resolved within the first 24 hours on treatment.</span> </p>    <p> Following the second dose, a further decrease in heart rate may occur when compared to the heart rate prior to the second dose, but this change is of a smaller magnitude than that observed following the first dose. With continued dosing, the heart rate returns to baseline within 1 month of chronic treatment. </p>    <p style="border-left:1px solid;"> <span class="XmChange"><span class="Italics">Atrioventricular Blocks</span></span> </p>    <p style="border-left:1px solid;"> <span class="XmChange">Initiation of GILENYA treatment has resulted in transient AV conduction delays. In controlled clinical trials, first-degree AV block after the first dose occurred in 4.7% of patients receiving GILENYA and 1.6% of patients on placebo. In a study of 697 patients with available 24-hour Holter monitoring data after their first dose (N=351 receiving GILENYA and N=346 on placebo), second-degree AV blocks (Mobitz Types I [Wenckebach] or 2:1 AV blocks) occurred in 4% (N=14) of patients receiving GILENYA and 2% (N=7) of patients on placebo. Of the 14 patients receiving GILENYA, 7 patients had 2:1 AV block (5 patients within the first 6 hours postdose and 2 patients after 6 hours postdose). All second degree AV blocks on placebo were Mobitz Type I and occurred after the first 12 hours postdose. The conduction abnormalities were usually transient and asymptomatic, and resolved within the first 24 hours on treatment, but they occasionally required treatment with atropine or isoproterenol.</span> </p>    <p> <span class="Italics">Postmarketing Experience</span> </p>    <p> In the postmarketing setting, third-degree AV block and AV block with junctional escape have been observed during the first-dose 6-hour observation period with GILENYA. Isolated delayed onset events, including transient asystole and unexplained death, have occurred within 24 hours of the first dose. These events were confounded by concomitant medications and/or preexisting disease, and the relationship to GILENYA is uncertain.

Because the elimination of fingolimod after discontinuation may take up to 2 months, continue monitoring for infections throughout this period.

One patient developed PML after taking GILENYA for approximately 2.5 years. The other patient developed probable PML after taking GILENYA for approximately 4 years. The diagnosis of probable PML was based on MRI findings and the detection of JCV DNA in the CSF in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms specific to PML. The patients had no other identified systemic medical conditions resulting in compromised immune system function and had not previously been treated with natalizumab, which has a known association with PML. The patients were also not taking any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications concomitantly. </span> </p>    <p style="border-left:1px solid;"> <span class="XmChange">At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold GILENYA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation.

The primary findings included increase in lung weight, associated with smooth muscle hypertrophy, hyperdistension of the alveoli, and/or increased collagen. Insufficient or lack of pulmonary collapse at necropsy, generally correlated with microscopic changes, was observed in all species. In rats and monkeys, lung toxicity was observed at all oral doses tested in chronic studies. The lowest doses tested in rats (0.05 mg/kg/day in the 2-year carcinogenicity study) and monkeys (0.5 mg/kg/day in the 39-week toxicity study) are similar to and approximately 20 times the RHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively.</p>    <p>In the 52-week oral study in monkeys, respiratory distress associated with ketamine administration was observed at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day; the most affected animal became hypoxic and required oxygenation.

In a subsequent study in rats, ketamine was shown to potentiate the bronchoconstrictive effects of fingolimod.

Both studies included patients who had experienced at least 2 clinical relapses during the 2 years prior to randomization or at least 1 clinical relapse during the 1 year prior to randomization, and had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 0 to 5.5. Study 1 was a 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with RRMS who had not received any interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate for at least the previous 3 months and had not received any natalizumab for at least the previous 6 months. Neurological evaluations were performed at screening, every 3 months and at time of suspected relapse. MRI evaluations were performed at screening, Month 6, Month 12, and Month 24. The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate.</p>   <p>Median age was 37 years, median disease duration was 6.7 years and median EDSS score at baseline was 2.0. Patients were randomized to receive GILENYA 0.5 mg (N=425), 1.25 mg (N=429), or placebo (N=418) for up to 24 months. Median time on study drug was 717 days on 0.5 mg, 715 days on 1.25 mg and 719 days on placebo.</p>   <p>The annualized relapse rate was significantly lower in patients treated with GILENYA than in patients who received placebo.
