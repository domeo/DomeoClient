<body><br><br><p><br><br>Concurrent use of rifampin increases the metabolic clearance of bisoprolol fumarate shortening its elimination half-life. However, initial dose modification is generally not necessary. Pharmacokinetic studies document no clinically relevant interactions with other agents given concomitantly, including thiazide diuretics and cimetidine. There was no effect of bisoprolol fumarate on prothrombin times in patients on stable doses of warfarin.<br></p><br><br></body>
