can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur during the starting period and with a higher dose (resulting in a higher INR). Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR &gt;4.0), agehighly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, serious heart disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal insufficiency, concomitant drugs (see<span class="Underline">PRECAUTIONS</span>) and long duration of warfarin therapy. Regular monitoring of INR should be performed on all treated patients. Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shorter duration of therapy. Patients should be instructed about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report immediately to physicians signs and symptoms of bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS:<span class="Underline">Information for Patients</span>).<br><br></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34089-3"></a><a name="section-1"></a><p></p><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>            Warfarin sodium tablet (crystalline warfarin sodium) is an anticoagulant, which acts by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Chemically, it is 3-(and is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Crystalline warfarin sodium is an isopropanol clathrate. The crystallization of warfarin sodium virtually eliminates trace impurities present in amorphous warfarin. Its molecular formula is C19H15NaO4, and its structural formula may be represented by the following:<br><div class="Figure"><img src="image.cfm?id=51079&type=img&name=MM1.jpg" alt="MM1"></div><br><br>Crystalline warfarin sodium occurs as a white crystalline powder, odorless or practically odorless.<br>Each warfarin sodium tablet intended for oral administration contains warfarin sodium clathrates equivalent to 1 mg or 2 mg or 2.5 mg or 3 mg or 4 mg or 5 mg or 6 mg or 7.5 mg or 10 mg of warfarin sodium. In addition each tablet contains the inactive ingredients hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate and pregelatinized starch. Additionally each 1 mg tablet contains D&amp;C red no. 6 barium lake, 2 mg tablet contains FD&amp;C blue no. 2 aluminum lake and FD&amp;C red no. 40 aluminum lake, 2.5 mg tablet contains D&amp;C yellow no. 10 aluminum lake and FD&amp;C blue no. 1 aluminum lake, 3 mg tablet contains FD&amp;C yellow no. 6 aluminum lake, FD&amp;C blue no. 2 aluminum lake and FD&amp;C red no. 40 aluminum lake, 4 mg tablet contains FD&amp;C blue no. 1 aluminum lake, 5 mg tablet contains FD&amp;C yellow no. 6 aluminum lake, 6 mg tablet contains FD&amp;C yellow no. 6 aluminum lake and FD&amp;C blue no. 1 aluminum lake, 7.5 mg tablet contains D&amp;C yellow no. 10 aluminum lake and FD&amp;C yellow no.6 aluminum lake and 10 mg tablet is dye free.<br><br></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34090-1"></a><a name="section-2"></a><p></p><h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>            Warfarin sodium tablets and other coumarin anticoagulants act by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K dependent clotting factors, which include Factors II, VII, IX and X, and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Half-lives of these clotting factors are as follows: Factor II - 60 hours, VII4 to 6 hours, IX - 24 hours, and X48 to 72 hours. The half-lives of proteins C and S are approximately 8 hours and 30 hours, respectively. The resultant in vivo effect is a sequential depression of Factor VII, Protein C, Factor IX, Protein S, and Factor X and II activities. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the post ribosomal synthesis of the vitamin K dependent clotting factors. The vitamin promotes the biosynthesis ofacid residues in the proteins which are essential for biological activity.<br><br><span class="Bold">              Mechanism of Action<br></span>Warfarin is thought to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibition of the C1 subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) enzyme complex, thereby reducing the regeneration of vitamin K1 epoxide. The degree of depression is dependent upon the dosage administered and, in part, by the patient's VKORC1 genotype. Therapeutic doses of warfarin decrease the total amount of the active form of each vitamin K dependent clotting factor made by the liver by approximately 30% to 50%.<br>An anticoagulation effect generally occurs within 24 hours after drug administration. However, peak anticoagulant effect may be delayed 72 to 96 hours. The duration of action of a single dose of racemic warfarin is 2 to 5 days. The effects of warfarin sodium tablets may become more pronounced as effects of daily maintenance doses overlap. Anticoagulants have no direct effect on an established thrombus, nor do they reverse ischemic tissue damage. However, once a thrombus has occurred, the goal of anticoagulant treatment is to prevent further extension of the formed clot and prevent secondary thromboembolic complications which may result in serious and possibly fatal sequelae.<br><br></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm43682-4"></a><a name="section-3"></a><p></p><h1>PHARMACOKINETICS</h1>            Warfarin sodium is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. The S-enantiomer exhibits 2 to 5 times more anticoagulant activity than the R-enantiomer in humans, but generally has a more rapid clearance.<br><br><span class="Bold">              Absorption<br></span>Warfarin sodium tablet is essentially completely absorbed after oral administration with peak concentration generally attained within the first 4 hours.<br><br><span class="Bold">              Distribution<br></span>There are no differences in the apparent volumes of distribution after intravenous and oral administration of single doses of warfarin solution. Warfarin distributes into a relatively small apparent volume of distribution of about 0.14 liter/kg. A distribution phase lasting 6 to 12 hours is distinguishable after rapid intravenous or oral administration of an aqueous solution. Using a one compartment model, and assuming complete bioavailability, estimates of the volumes of distribution of R- and S-warfarin are similar to each other and to that of the racemate. Concentrations in fetal plasma approach the maternal values, but warfarin has not been found in human milk (see<span class="Underline">WARNINGS: Lactation</span>). Approximately 99% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins.<br><br><span class="Bold">              Metabolism<br></span><br>The S-enantiomer of warfarin is mainly metabolized to 7-hydroxywarfarin by CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme. The variant alleles CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 result in decreased in vitro CYP2C9 enzymatic 7-hydroxylation of S-warfarin. The frequencies of these alleles in Caucasians are approximately 11% and 7% for CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, respectively1. Patients with one or more of these variant CYP2C9 alleles have decreased S-warfarin clearance (Table 1).2<br><br>Table 1 Relationship between S-Warfarin Clearance and CYP2C9 Genotype in Caucasian Patients<br>CYP2C9 GenotypeNS-Warfarin Clearance/Lean Body Weight(mL/min/kg)Mean (SD)<span class="Underline">*</span><span class="Underline">*</span>SD=standard deviation.<span class="Underline"></span>p&lt;0.001.

The analysis suggested an increased bleeding risk for patients carrying either the CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3 alleles. Patients carrying at least one copy of the CYP2C9*2 allele required a mean daily warfarin dose that was 17% less than the mean daily dose for patients homozygous for the CYP2C9*1 allele. For patients carrying at least one copy of the CYP2C9*3 allele, the mean daily warfarin dose was 37% less than the mean daily dose for patients homozygous for the CYP2C9*1 allele.<br>In an observational study, the risk of achieving INR &gt;3 during the first 3 weeks of warfarin therapy was determined in 219 Swedish patients retrospectively grouped by CYP2C9 genotype. The relative risk of over anticoagulation as measured by INR &gt;3 during the first 2 weeks of therapy was approximately doubled for those patients classified as *2 or *3 compared to patients who were homozygous for the *1 allele.4<br>Warfarin reduces the regeneration of vitamin K from vitamin K epoxide in the vitamin K cycle, through inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), a multiprotein enzyme complex. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene (especially the -1639G&gt;A allele) have been associated with lower dose requirements for warfarin. In 201 Caucasian patients treated with stable warfarin doses, genetic variations in the VKORC1 gene were associated with lower warfarin doses. In this study, about 30% of the variance in warfarin dose could be attributed to variations in the VKORC1 gene alone; about 40% of the variance in warfarin dose could be attributed to variations in VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes combined.5 About 55% of the variability in warfarin dose could be explained by the combination of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes, age, height, body weight, interacting drugs, and indication for warfarin therapy in Caucasian patients.5 Similar observations have been reported in Asian patients.6,7<br><br><span class="Bold">              Elderly<br></span>Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected PT/INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. The cause of the increased sensitivity to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin in this age group is unknown. This increased anticoagulant effect from warfarin may be due to a combination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors. Racemic warfarin clearance may be unchanged or reduced with increasing age. Limited information suggests there is no difference in the clearance of S-warfarin in the elderly versus young subjects. However, there may be a slight decrease in the clearance of R-warfarin in the elderly as compared to the young. Therefore, as patient age increases, a lower dose of warfarin is usually required to produce a therapeutic level of anticoagulation.<br><br><span class="Bold">              Asians<br></span>Asian patients may require lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin. One non-controlled study conducted in 151 Chinese outpatients reported a mean daily warfarin requirement of 3.31.4 mg to achieve an INR of 2 to 2.5. These patients were stabilized on warfarin for various indications. Patient age was the most important determinant of warfarin requirement in Chinese patients with a progressively lower warfarin requirement with increasing age.<br><br><span class="Bold">              Renal Dysfunction<br></span>Renal clearance is considered to be a minor determinant of anticoagulant response to warfarin.

The risk reduction ranged from 60% to 86% in all except one trial (CAFA: 45%) which stopped early due to published positive results from two of these trials. The incidence of major bleeding in these trials ranged from 0.6 % to 2.7% (see<span class="Underline">Table 2</span>). Meta-analysis findings of these studies revealed that the effects of warfarin in reducing thromboembolic events including stroke were similar at either moderately high INR (2.0-4.5) or low INR (1.4-3.0). There was a significant reduction in minor bleeds at the low INR.

Furthermore, there have been reports of birth malformations in children born to mothers who have been treated with warfarin during pregnancy.<br>Embryopathy characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata) has been reported in pregnant women exposed to warfarin during the first trimester. Central nervous system abnormalities also have been reported, including dorsal midline dysplasia characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker malformation, and midline cerebellar atrophy. Ventral midline dysplasia, characterized by optic atrophy, and eye abnormalities have been observed. Mental retardation, blindness, and other central nervous system abnormalities have been reported in association with second and third trimester exposure.

If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, she should be apprised of the potential risks to the fetus, and the possibility of termination of the pregnancy should be discussed in light of those risks.<br><br><br></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34071-1"></a><a name="section-6"></a><p></p><h1>WARNINGS</h1>            The most serious risks associated with anticoagulant therapy with warfarin sodium are hemorrhage in any tissue or organ12 (see<span class="Underline">BLACK BOX WARNING</span>) and, less frequently (&lt;0.1%), necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues. Hemorrhage and necrosis have in some cases been reported to result in death or permanent disability. Necrosis appears to be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of anticoagulant therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast or penis has been reported. Careful diagnosis is required to determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Warfarin therapy should be discontinued when warfarin is suspected to be the cause of developing necrosis and heparin therapy may be considered for anticoagulation. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. See below for information on predisposing conditions. These and other risks associated with anticoagulant therapy must be weighed against the risk of thrombosis or embolization in untreated cases.<br>It cannot be emphasized too strongly that treatment of each patient is a highly individualized matter. Warfarin sodium tablets, a narrow therapeutic range (index) drug, may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Dosage should be controlled by periodic determinations of prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR). Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for control of therapy. Heparin prolongs the one-stage PT. When heparin and warfarin sodium tablets are administered concomitantly, refer below to CONVERSION FROM HEPARIN THERAPY for recommendations.<br>Increased caution should be observed when warfarin sodium tablets are administered in the presence of any predisposing condition where added risk of hemorrhage, necrosis, and/or gangrene is present.<br>Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium tablets may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli, thereby increasing the risk of complications from systemic cholesterol microembolization, including the "purple toes syndrome". Discontinuation of warfarin sodium tablets therapy is recommended when such phenomena are observed.<br>Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms including purple toes syndrome, livedo reticularis, rash, gangrene, abrupt and intense pain in the leg, foot, or toes, foot ulcers, myalgia, penile gangrene, abdominal pain, flank or back pain, hematuria, renal insufficiency, hypertension, cerebral ischemia, spinal cord infarction, pancreatitis, symptoms simulating polyarteritis, or any other sequelae of vascular compromise due to embolic occlusion. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death.<br>Purple toes syndrome is a complication of oral anticoagulation characterized by a dark, purplish or mottled color of the toes, usually occurring between 3 to 10 weeks, or later, after the initiation of therapy with warfarin or related compounds. Major features of this syndrome include purple color of plantar surfaces and sides of the toes that blanches on moderate pressure and fades with elevation of the legs; pain and tenderness of the toes; waxing and waning of the color over time. While the purple toes syndrome is reported to be reversible, some cases progress to gangrene or necrosis which may require debridement of the affected area, or may lead to amputation.<br>Warfarin sodium tablets should be used with caution in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and deep venous thrombosis. Cases of venous limb ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene have occurred in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and deep venous thrombosis when heparin treatment was discontinued and warfarin therapy was started or continued. In some patients sequelae have included amputation of the involved area and/or death.13<br>The decision to administer anticoagulants in the following conditions must be based upon clinical judgment in which the risks of anticoagulant therapy are weighed against the benefits:<br><br><span class="Bold">              Lactation<br></span>Based on very limited published data, warfarin has not been detected in the breast milk of mothers treated with warfarin. The same limited published data report that some breast-fed infants, whose mothers were treated with warfarin, had prolonged prothrombin times, although not as prolonged as those of the mothers. The decision to breast-feed should be undertaken only after careful consideration of the available alternatives. Women who are breast-feeding and anticoagulated with warfarin should be very carefully monitored so that recommended PT/INR values are not exceeded. It is prudent to perform coagulation tests and to evaluate vitamin K status in infants before advising women taking warfarin to breast-feed.

Inherited resistance to activated protein C has been described in many patients with venous thromboembolic disorders but has not yet been evaluated as a risk factor for tissue necrosis. The risk associated with these conditions, both for recurrent thrombosis and for adverse reactions, is difficult to evaluate since it does not appear to be the same for everyone. Decisions about testing and therapy must be made on an individual basis. It has been reported that concomitant anticoagulation therapy with heparin for 5 to 7 days during initiation of therapy with warfarin sodium tablets may minimize the incidence of tissue necrosis. Warfarin therapy should be discontinued when warfarin is suspected to be the cause of developing necrosis and heparin therapy may be considered for anticoagulation.<br><br><span class="Bold">              Miscellaneous<br></span>Polycythemia vera, vasculitis, and severe diabetes.<br><br></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42232-9"></a><a name="section-7"></a><p></p><h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>            Periodic determination of PT/INR is essential (see<span class="Underline">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>:<span class="Underline">Laboratory control</span>).

Reported risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR &gt;4.0), agehighly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, serious heart disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal insufficiency, concomitant drugs (see<span class="Underline">PRECAUTIONS</span>) and long duration of warfarin therapy. Identification of risk factors for bleeding and certain genetic variations in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 in a patient may increase the need for more frequent INR monitoring and the use of lower warfarin doses (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:<span class="Underline">PharmacokineticsMetabolism</span>and<span class="Underline">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). Bleeding is more likely to occur during the starting period and with a higher dose of warfarin sodium (resulting in a higher INR).<br>Intramuscular (I.M.) injections of concomitant medications should be confined to the upper extremities which permits easy access for manual compression, inspections for bleeding and use of pressure bandages.<br>Caution should be observed when warfarin sodium tablets are administered concomitantly with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, to be certain that no change in anticoagulation dosage is required. In addition to specific drug interactions that might affect PT/INR, NSAIDs, including aspirin, can inhibit platelet aggregation, and can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulceration and/or perforation.<br><br></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34076-0"></a><a name="section-8"></a><p></p><h1>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</h1>            The objective of anticoagulant therapy is to decrease the clotting ability of the blood so that thrombosis is prevented, while avoiding spontaneous bleeding. Effective therapeutic levels with minimal complications are in part dependent upon cooperative and well-instructed patients who communicate effectively with their physician. Patients should be advised: Strict adherence to prescribed dosage schedule is necessary. Do not take or discontinue any other medication, including salicylates (e.g., aspirin and topical analgesics), other over-the-counter medications, and botanical (herbal) products except on advice of the physician. Avoid alcohol consumption. Do not take warfarin sodium tablets during pregnancy and do not become pregnant while taking it (see<span class="Underline">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>). Avoid any activity or sport that may result in traumatic injury. Prothrombin time tests and regular visits to physician or clinic are needed to monitor therapy. Carry identification stating that warfarin sodium tablets are being taken. If the prescribed dose of warfarin sodium tablets is forgotten, notify the physician immediately. Take the dose as soon as possible on the same day but do not take a double dose of warfarin sodium tablets the next day to make up for missed doses. The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with warfarin sodium tablets. Eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables. You should also avoid intake of cranberry juice or any other cranberry products. Notify your healthcare provider if any of these products are part of your normal diet. Contact physician to report any illness, such as diarrhea, infection or fever. Notify physician immediately if any unusual bleeding or symptoms occur. Signs and symptoms of bleeding include: pain, swelling or discomfort, prolonged bleeding from cuts, increased menstrual flow or vaginal bleeding, nosebleeds, bleeding of gums from brushing, unusual bleeding or bruising, red or dark brown urine, red or tar black stools, headache, dizziness, or weakness. If therapy with warfarin sodium tablets is discontinued, patients should be cautioned that the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium tablets may persist for about 2 to 5 days. Patients should be informed that all warfarin sodium, USP, products represent the same medication, and should not be taken concomitantly, as overdosage may result. A Medication Guide14 should be available to patients when their prescriptions for warfarin sodium are issued.<br><br></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34083-6"></a><a name="section-9"></a><p></p><h1>CARCINOGENESIS &amp; MUTAGENESIS &amp; IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY</h1>            Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity studies have not been performed with warfarin sodium tablets.

For patients with a first episode of idiopathic DVT or PE, warfarin is recommended for at least 6 to 12 months. For patients with two or more episodes of documented DVT or PE, indefinite treatment with warfarin is suggested. For patients with a first episode of DVT or PE who have documented antiphospholipid antibodies or who have two or more thrombophilic conditions, treatment for 12 months is recommended and indefinite therapy is suggested. For patients with a first episode of DVT or PE who have documented deficiency of antithrombin, deficiency of Protein C or Protein S, or the Factor V Leiden or prothrombin 20210 gene mutation, homocystinemia, or high Factor VIII levels (&gt;90th percentile of normal), treatment for 6 to 12 months is recommended and indefinite therapy is suggested for idiopathic thrombosis. The risk-benefit should be reassessed periodically in patients who receive indefinite anticoagulant treatment.12, 20 The dose of warfarin should be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. These recommendations are supported by the American College of Chest Physicians'(7th ACCP) guidelines.15, 17, 21, 22<br><br><span class="Bold">              Atrial Fibrillation<br></span>Five clinical trials evaluated the effects of warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Meta-analysis findings of these studies revealed that the effects of warfarin in reducing thromboembolic events including stroke were similar at either moderately high INR (2.0 to 4.5) or low INR (1.4 to 3.0). There was a significant reduction in minor bleeds at the low INR. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in populations with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease. Similar data from clinical studies in valvular atrial fibrillation patients are not available. The trials in non-valvular atrial fibrillation support the 7th ACCP recommendation that an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 be used for warfarin therapy in appropriate AF patients.17<br>Oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is recommended in patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF (PAF) (intermittent AF) at high risk of stroke (i.e., having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, age &gt;75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or congestive heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus). In patients with persistent AF or PAF, age 65 to 75 years, in the absence of other risk factors, but who are at intermediate risk of stroke, antithrombotic therapy with either oral warfarin or aspirin, 325 mg/day, is recommended. For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, anticoagulation with oral warfarin is recommended (7th ACCP). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, anticoagulation with oral warfarin should be used; the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors.17<br><br><span class="Bold">              Post-Myocardial Infarction<br></span>mg/day) for 3 months after the MI is suggested.23<br><br><span class="Bold">              Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves<br></span>For all patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, warfarin is recommended.

For patients with tilting disk valves and bileaflet mechanical valves in the mitral position, the 7th ACCP recommends a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5). For patients with caged ball or caged disk valves, a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) in combination with aspirin, 75 to 100 mg/day is recommended. For patients with bioprosthetic valves, warfarin therapy with a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended for valves in the mitral position and is suggested for valves in the aortic position for the first 3 months after valve insertion.15<br><br><span class="Bold">              Recurrent Systemic Embolism and Other Indications<br></span>Oral anticoagulation therapy has not been evaluated by properly designed clinical trials in patients with valvular disease associated with atrial fibrillation, patients with mitral stenosis, and patients with recurrent systemic embolism of unknown etiology.

Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this may increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation. If the patient's CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known, the initial dose of warfarin sodium tablets is usually 2 to 5 mg per day. Modify this dose based on consideration of patient-specific clinical factors. Consider lower initiation doses for elderly and/or debilitated patients (see<span class="Underline">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>and<span class="Underline">PRECAUTIONS</span>).<br>The patient's CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype information, when available, can assist in selection of the starting dose. Table 5 describes the range of stable maintenance doses observed in multiple patients having different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants. Consider these ranges in choosing the initial dose.<br>In all patients, subsequent dosage adjustments must be made based on the results of PT/INR determinations.17, 18<br><br>Table 5Range of Expected Therapeutic Warfarin Doses Based on CYP2C9 and VKORC1 Genotypes<span class="Underline">*</span><br>VKORC1CYP2C9<span class="Underline">*</span>Ranges are derived from multiple published clinical studies.

Acquired or inherited warfarin resistance is rare, but should be suspected if large daily doses of warfarin sodium tablets are required to maintain a patient's PT/INR within a normal therapeutic range. Lower maintenance doses are recommended for elderly and/or debilitated patients and patients with a potential to exhibit greater than expected PT/INR response to warfarin sodium tablets (see<span class="Underline">PRECAUTIONS</span>).<br><br><span class="Bold">              Duration of Therapy<br></span>The duration of therapy in each patient should be individualized.

The patient should not take the missed dose by doubling the daily dose to make up for missed doses, but should refer back to his or her physician.<br><span class="Bold">              LABORATORY CONTROL<br></span>The PT reflects the depression of vitamin K dependent Factors VII, X and II. A system of standardizing the PT in oral anticoagulant control was introduced by the World Health Organization in 1983. It is based upon the determination of an International Normalized Ratio (INR) which provides a common basis for communication of PT results and interpretations of therapeutic ranges.24The PT should be determined daily after the administration of the initial dose until PT/INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. Intervals between subsequent PT/INR determinations should be based upon the physician's judgment of the patient's reliability and response to warfarin sodium tablets in order to maintain the individual within the therapeutic range. Acceptable intervals for PT/INR determinations are normally within the range of 1 to 4 weeks after a stable dosage has been determined. To ensure adequate control, it is recommended that additional PT tests be done when other warfarin products are interchanged with warfarin sodium tablets, USP, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly (see<span class="Underline">PRECAUTIONS</span>). Safety and efficacy of warfarin therapy can be improved by increasing the quality of laboratory control. Reports suggest that in usual care monitoring, patients are in therapeutic range only 33% to 64% of the time. Time in therapeutic range is significantly greater (56% to 93%) in patients managed by anticoagulation clinics, among self-testing and self-monitoring patients, and in patients managed with the help of computer programs.25 Self-testing patients had fewer bleeding events than patients in usual care.25<br><br><span class="Bold">              TREATMENT DURING DENTISTRY AND SURGERY<br></span>The management of patients who undergo dental and surgical procedures requires close liaison between attending physicians, surgeons and dentists.15, 19 PT/INR determination is recommended just prior to any dental or surgical procedure. In patients undergoing minimal invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to, during, or immediately following these procedures, adjusting the dosage of warfarin sodium tablets to maintain the PT/INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation. The operative site should be sufficiently limited and accessible to permit the effective use of local procedures for hemostasis. Under these conditions, dental and minor surgical procedures may be performed without undue risk of hemorrhage. Some dental or surgical procedures may necessitate the interruption of warfarin sodium tablets therapy. When discontinuing warfarin sodium tablets even for a short period of time, the benefits and risks should be strongly considered.<br><br><span class="Bold">              CONVERSION FROM HEPARIN THERAPY<br></span>Since the anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium tablets is delayed, heparin is preferred initially for rapid anticoagulation. Conversion to warfarin sodium tablets may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 6 days. To ensure continuous anticoagulation, it is advisable to continue full dose heparin therapy and that warfarin sodium tablets therapy be overlapped with heparin for 4 to 5 days, until warfarin sodium tablets have produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by PT/INR. When warfarin sodium tablets have produced the desired PT/INR or prothrombin activity, heparin may be discontinued.<br>Warfarin sodium tablets may increase the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test, even in the absence of heparin. A severe elevation (&gt;50 seconds) in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) with a PT/INR in the desired range has been identified as an indication of increased risk of postoperative hemorrhage.<br>During initial therapy with warfarin sodium tablets, the interference with heparin anticoagulation is of minimal clinical significance.<br>As heparin may affect the PT/INR, patients receiving both heparin and warfarin sodium tablets should have blood for PT/INR determination drawn at least:<br><dl class="Disc"><dt>●</dt><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 hours after the last IV bolus dose of heparin, or              </dd></dl><dl class="Disc"><dt>●</dt><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 hours after cessation of a continuous IV infusion of heparin, or              </dd></dl><dl class="Disc"><dt>●</dt><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24 hours after the last subcutaneous heparin injection.              </dd></dl><br></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34069-5"></a><a name="section-15"></a><p></p><h1>HOW SUPPLIED</h1>            Warfarin Sodium Tablets, 1 mg are pink, oval, flat, beveled edge, uncoated tablets debossed with the logo ofWAR',1'and bisect on one side and plain on other side and are supplied as follows:<br>NDC 68382-052-01 in bottles of 100 tablets<br>NDC 68382-052-10 in bottles of 1000 tablets<br>Warfarin Sodium Tablets, 2 mg are lavender, oval, flat, beveled edge, uncoated tablets debossed with the logo ofWAR',2'and bisect on one side and plain on other side and are supplied as follows:<br>NDC 68382-053-01 in bottles of 100 tablets<br>NDC 68382-053-10 in bottles of 1000 tablets<br>Warfarin Sodium Tablets, 2.5 mg are green, oval, flat, beveled edge, uncoated tablets debossed with the logo ofWAR',2'and bisect on one side and plain on other side and are supplied as follows:<br>NDC 68382-064-01 in bottles of 100 tablets<br>NDC 68382-064-10 in bottles of 1000 tablets<br>Warfarin Sodium Tablets, 3 mg are tan, oval, flat, beveled edge, uncoated tablets debossed with the logo ofWAR',3'and bisect on one side and plain on other side and are supplied as follows:<br>NDC 68382-054-01 in bottles of 100 tablets<br>NDC 68382-054-10 in bottles of 1000 tablets<br>Warfarin Sodium Tablets, 4 mg are blue, oval, flat, beveled edge, uncoated tablets debossed with the logo ofWAR',4'and bisect on one side and plain on other side and are supplied as follows:<br>NDC 68382-055-01 in bottles of 100 tablets<br>NDC 68382-055-10 in bottles of 1000 tablets<br>Warfarin Sodium Tablets, 5 mg are peach, oval, flat, beveled edge, uncoated tablets debossed with the logo ofWAR',5'and bisect on one side and plain on other side and are supplied as follows:<br>NDC 68382-056-01 in bottles of 100 tablets<br>NDC 68382-056-10 in bottles of 1000 tablets<br>Warfarin Sodium Tablets, 6 mg are teal, oval, flat, beveled edge, uncoated tablets debossed with the logo ofWAR',6'and bisect on one side and plain on other side and are supplied as follows:<br>NDC 68382-057-01 in bottles of 100 tablets<br>NDC 68382-057-10 in bottles of 1000 tablets<br>Warfarin Sodium Tablets, 7.5 mg are yellow, oval, flat, beveled edge, uncoated tablets debossed with the logo ofWAR',7'and bisect on one side and plain on other side and are supplied as follows:<br>NDC 68382-058-01 in bottles of 100 tablets<br>Warfarin Sodium Tablets, 10 mg are white to off white, oval, flat, beveled edge, uncoated tablets debossed with the logo ofWAR',10'and bisect on one side and plain on other side and are supplied as follows:<br>NDC 68382-059-01 in bottles of 100 tablets<br><br></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm44425-7"></a><a name="section-16"></a><p></p><h1>STORAGE AND HANDLING</h1>            Store at 20- 25(68- 77[see USP Controlled Room Temperature].
