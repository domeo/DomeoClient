Carbamazepine is a white to off-white powder, practically insoluble in water and soluble in alcohol and in acetone. Its molecular weight is 236.27. Its chemical name is 5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide, and its structural formula is:</p><p><img src="image.cfm?id=45020&type=img&name=carbamazepine%2Dspl%2Dimg.jpg" alt="Carbamazepine Structure"></p><p>Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules contain a single type of beads designed to provide twice daily dosing of carbamazepine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Inactive ingredients</span>: silicified microcrystalline cellulose, oleic acid, ethylcellulose, medium chain triglycerides, polyethylene glycols, hypromellose and sodium lauryl sulfate.</p><p>The 300 mg capsule shells contain gelatin, D&amp;C Red #28, FD&amp;C Blue #1, black iron oxide, titanium dioxide, and are imprinted with black ink.</p><p>The imprinting ink contains the following: black iron oxide, D&amp;C Yellow # 10 Aluminum Lake, FD&amp;C Blue #1/ Brilliant Blue FCF Aluminum Lake, FD&amp;C Blue #2/ Indigo Carmine Aluminum Lake, FD&amp;C Red # 40/ Allura Red AC Aluminum Lake, propylene glycol and shellac glaze.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34090-1"></a><a name="clinical-pharm"></a><a name="section-3"></a><p></p><h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1><p class="First">In controlled clinical trials, carbamazepine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of psychomotor and grand mal seizures, as well as trigeminal neuralgia.</p><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="section-3.1"></a><p></p><h2>Mechanism of Action</h2><p class="First">Carbamazepine has demonstrated anticonvulsant properties in rats and mice with electrically and chemically induced  seizures. It appears to act by reducing polysynaptic responses and blocking the post-tetanic potentiation. Carbamazepine  greatly reduces or abolishes pain induced by stimulation of the   infraorbital nerve in cats and rats. It depresses thalamic  potential and bulbar and polysynaptic reflexes, including the  linguomandibular reflex in cats. Carbamazepine is chemically  unrelated to other anticonvulsants or other drugs used to control the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. The mechanism of action remains unknown.</p><p>The principal metabolite of carbamazepine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, has anticonvulsant activity as demonstrated in several <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> animal models of seizures. Though clinical activity for the epoxide has been postulated, the significance  of its activity with respect to the safety and efficacy of carbamazepine has not been established.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p><h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carbamazepine (CBZ):</span> Taken every 12 hours, Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules   provide steady state plasma levels comparable to  immediate-release carbamazepine tablets given every 6 hours, when administered at the same total mg daily dose. </p><p>Following a single 200 mg oral extended-release dose of carbamazepine, peak plasma concentration was 1.9 &plusmn; 0.3 &micro;g/mL and the time to reach the peak was 19 &plusmn;  7 hours. Following chronic administration (800 mg every 12  hours), the peak levels were 11.0 &plusmn; 2.5 &micro;g/mL  and the time to reach the peak was 5.9 &plusmn; 1.8 hours. The pharmacokinetics of extended-release carbamazepine is linear over the single dose range of 200 to 800 mg. </p><p>Carbamazepine is 76% bound to plasma proteins.  Carbamazepine is primarily metabolized in the liver. Cytochrome  P450 3A4 was identified as the major isoform responsible for the  formation of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide. Since carbamazepine  induces its own metabolism, the half-life is also variable. Following a single extended-release dose of carbamazepine, the average half-life range from 35 to 40 hours and 12 to 17 hours on repeated dosing. The apparent oral clearance following a single  dose was 25 &plusmn; 5 mL/min and following multiple dosing was 80 &plusmn; 30 mL/min.</p><p>After oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-carbamazepine, 72% of the administered  radioactivity was found in the urine and 28% in the feces. This urinary radioactivity was composed largely of hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites, with only 3% of unchanged carbamazepine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E):</span> Carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide is considered to be an active metabolite of carbamazepine. Following a single  200 mg oral extended-release dose of carbamazepine, the peak plasma concentration of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide was 0.11 &plusmn; 0.012 &micro;g/mL and the time to reach the peak was 36 &plusmn; 6 hours. Following chronic administration of a extended-release dose of carbamazepine (800 mg every 12 hours), the peak levels of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide were 2.2 &plusmn; 0.9 &micro;g/mL and the time to reach the peak was 14 &plusmn; 8 hours. The plasma half-life of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide following administration of carbamazepine is 34 &plusmn; 9 hours. Following a single oral dose of extended-release carbamazepine (200 to 800 mg) the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide were less than 10% of carbamazepine. Following multiple dosing of extended-release carbamazepine (800 to 1600 mg daily for 14 days), the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide were dose related, ranging from 15.7 &micro;g.hr/mL and 1.5 &micro;g/mL at 800 mg/day to 32.6 &micro;g.hr/mL and 3.2 &micro;g/mL at 1600 mg/day, respectively, and were less than 30% of carbamazepine. Carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide is 50% bound to plasma proteins.</p><p><span class="Bold">Food Effect:</span>The multiple dose study conducted in the fed state showed that the steady-state C<span class="Sub">max</span> values were within the therapeutic concentration range. The pharmacokinetic profile of extended-release carbamazepine was similar when given by sprinkling the beads over applesauce compared to the intact capsule administered in the fasted state.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="section-3.3"></a><p></p><h2>Special Populations</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatic Dysfunction:</span> The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine is not known. However, given that carbamazepine is primarily metabolized in the liver, it is prudent to proceed with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Dysfunction:</span>The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of  carbamazepine is not known.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gender:</span> No difference in the mean AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of carbamazepine andcarbamazepine-10,11-epoxide was found between males and females.</p><p><span class="Bold">Age:</span> Carbamazepine is more rapidly metabolized to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide in young children than adults. In children below the age of 15, there is an inverse relationship between CBZ-E/CBZ ratio and increasing age.</p><p><span class="Bold">Race:</span> No information is available on the effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine.</p></div></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34067-9"></a><a name="indications"></a><a name="section-4"></a><p></p><h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="section-4.1"></a><p></p><h2>Epilepsy</h2><p class="First">Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules are indicated for use as an anticonvulsant drug. Evidence supporting efficacy of carbamazepine as an anticonvulsant was derived from active drug-controlled studies that enrolled patients with the following seizure types:</p><ol><li>Partial seizures with complex symptomatology (psychomotor, temporal lobe). Patients with these seizures appear to show greater improvements than those with other types.</li><li>Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal).</li><li>Mixed seizure patterns which include the above, or other partial or generalized seizures. Absence seizures (petit mal) do not appear to be controlled by carbamazepine (see <a href="#precautions-general">PRECAUTIONS, General</a>).</li></ol></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="section-4.2"></a><p></p><h2>Trigeminal Neuralgia</h2><p class="First">Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules are indicated in the treatment of the pain associated with true trigeminal neuralgia.</p><p>Beneficial results have also been reported in glossopharyngeal neuralgia. This drug is not a simple analgesic and should not be used for the relief of trivial aches or pains.</p></div></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34070-3"></a><a name="contraindications"></a><a name="section-5"></a><p></p><h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1><p class="First">Carbamazepine should not be used in patients with a history of previous bone marrow depression, hypersensitivity to the drug, or known sensitivity to any of the tricyclic compounds, such as amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, protriptyline and nortriptyline. Likewise, on theoretical grounds its use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors is not recommended. Before administration of carbamazepine, MAO inhibitors should be discontinued for a minimum of 14 days, or longer if the clinical situation permits.</p><p>Coadministration of carbamazepine and nefazodone may result in insufficient plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite to achieve a therapeutic effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34071-1"></a><a name="warnings"></a><a name="section-6"></a><p></p><h1>WARNINGS</h1><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p><h2>Serious Dermatologic Reactions</h2><p class="First">Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. </p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="section-6.2"></a><p></p><h2>SJS/TEN and HLA-B*1502 Allele</h2><p class="First">Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B*1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity.</p><p>Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B*1502. Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including Indians, appear to have intermediate prevalence of HLA-B*1502, averaging 2 to 4%, but higher in some groups. HLA-B*1502 is present in &lt;1% of the population in Japan and Korea.</p><p>HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans).</p><p><span class="Bold">Prior to initiating Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsule therapy, testing for HLA-B*1502 should be performed in patients with ancestry in populations in which HLA-B*1502 may be present.</span>  In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the prevalence of HLA-B*1502 may offer a rough guide, keeping in mind the limitations of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Tested patients who are found to be negative for the allele are thought to have a low risk of SJS/TEN <span class="Bold">(see<a href="#warnings">WARNINGS</a> and<a href="#precautions-lab"> PRECAUTIONS/Laboratory Tests</a>).</span></p><p>Over 90% of carbamazepine treated patients who will experience SJS/TEN have this reaction within the first few months of treatment. This information may be taken into consideration in determining the need for screening of genetically at-risk patients currently on Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules.</p><p>The HLA-B*1502 allele has not been found to predict risk of less severe adverse cutaneous reactions from carbamazepine, such as anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome or non-serious rash (maculopapular eruption [MPE]).</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Chinese ancestry taking other anti-epileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN. Consideration should be given to avoiding use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B* 1502 positive  patients, when alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable.</p><p>Application of HLA-B*1502 genotyping as a screening tool has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. Many HLA-B*1502-positive Asian patients treated with carbamazepine will not develop SJS/TEN, and these reactions can still occur infrequently in HLA-B*1502-negative patients of any ethnicity. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as AED dose, compliance, concomitant medications, co-morbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied.</p><p>Patients should be made aware that Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules contains carbamazepine and should not be used in combination with any other medications containing carbamazepine.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="section-6.3"></a><p></p><h2>Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis</h2><p class="First">Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have been reported in association with the use of carbamazepine. Data from a population-based case-control study demonstrate that the risk of developing these reactions is 5-8 times greater than in the general population. However, the overall risk of these reactions in the untreated general population is low, approximately six patients per one million population per year for agranulocytosis and two patients per one million population per year for aplastic anemia.</p><p>Although reports of transient or persistent decreased platelet or white blood cell counts are not uncommon in association with the use of carbamazepine, data are not available to estimate accurately their incidence or outcome. However, the vast majority of the cases of leukopenia have not progressed to the more serious conditions of aplastic anemia or agranulocytosis. Because of the very low incidence of agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia, the vast majority of minor hematologic changes observed in monitoring of patients on carbamazepine are unlikely to signal the occurrence of either abnormality. Nonetheless, complete pretreatment hematological testing should be obtained as a baseline. If a patient in the course of treatment exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely. Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="section-6.4"></a><p></p><h2>Suicidal behavior and Ideation</h2><p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><table><caption><span>Table 1 &ndash; Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis</span></caption><thead><tr class="First Last"><td align="center" valign="top">Indication</td><td align="center" valign="top"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placebo<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients with<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events Per<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1000 Patients</span></td><td align="center" valign="top"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug Patients<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Events<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Per 1000<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients</span></td><td align="center" valign="top"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative Risk:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidence of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug Patients/<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidence in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placebo<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients</span></td><td align="center" valign="top"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difference:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug Patients<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Events<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Per 1000<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients</span></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="First"><td class="Toprule"><span>Epilepsy</span></td><td class="Toprule" align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.0</td><td class="Toprule" align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.4</td><td class="Toprule" align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5</td><td class="Toprule" align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4</td></tr><tr><td><span>Psychiatric</span></td><td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.7</td><td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.5</td><td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5</td><td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.9</td></tr><tr><td><span>Other</span></td><td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.0</td><td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.8</td><td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.9</td><td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.9</td></tr><tr class="Last"><td class="Botrule"><span>Total</span></td><td class="Botrule" align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4</td><td class="Botrule" align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3</td><td class="Botrule" align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.8</td><td class="Botrule" align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.9</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p><p>Anyone considering prescribing Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="section-6.5"></a><p></p><h2>Usage in Pregnancy</h2><p class="First">Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.</p><p>Epidemiological data suggest that there may be an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including spina bifida. The prescribing physician will wish to weigh the benefits of therapy against the risks in treating or counseling women of childbearing potential. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><p>Retrospective case reviews suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy.</p><p>In humans, transplacental passage of carbamazepine is rapid (30 to 60 minutes), and the drug is accumulated in the fetal tissues, with higher levels found in liver and kidney than in brain and lung.</p><p>Carbamazepine has been shown to have adverse effects in reproduction studies in rats when given orally in dosages 10 to 25 times the maximum human daily dosage (MHDD) of 1200 mg on a mg/kg basis or 1.5 to 4 times the MHDD on a mg/m2 basis.
