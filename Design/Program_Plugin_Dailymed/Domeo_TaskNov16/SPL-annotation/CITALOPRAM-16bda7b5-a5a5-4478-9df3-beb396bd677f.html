Drugs</h1><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of citalopram tablets or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Citalopram tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients (see WARNINGS, Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients; and PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).</span></p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34089-3"></a><a name="i4i_description_id_268da776-ccb6-4201-aa6c-42ad6f8ff73f"></a><a name="section-1"></a><p></p><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1><p class="First">Citalopram HBr is an orally administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with a chemical structure unrelated to that of other SSRIs or of tricyclic, tetracyclic, or other available antidepressant agents.

Tolerance to the inhibition of 5-HT uptake is not induced by long-term (14 day) treatment of rats with citalopram. Citalopram is a racemic mixture (50/50), and the inhibition of 5-HT reuptake by citalopram is primarily due to the (S)-enantiomer.</p><p>Citalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span>, dopamine D<span class="Sub">1</span> and D<span class="Sub">2</span>, α<span class="Sub">1</span>-, α<span class="Sub">2</span>-, and β-adrenergic, histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span>, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic, cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of other psychotropic drugs.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm43682-4"></a><a name="i4i_pharmacokinetics_id_35f8e2c0-4728-496c-ab05-d73824a880bf"></a><a name="section-2.2"></a><p></p><h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2><p class="First">The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 60 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose. The tablet and oral solution dosage forms of citalopram HBr are bioequivalent.</p><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_4991bc53-aef2-4932-bb53-2bcdd378b253"></a><a name="section-2.2.1"></a><p></p><h3>Absorption and Distribution</h3><p class="First">Following a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food. The volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_97cab029-19a0-4636-83f8-93277f11dbb6"></a><a name="section-2.2.2"></a><p></p><h3>Metabolism and Elimination</h3><p class="First">Following intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.</p><p>Citalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_752bd3d5-0482-458c-b846-eec498a26b16"></a><a name="section-2.2.3"></a><p></p><h3>Population Subgroups</h3><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_2f478f14-0ced-4da6-8d94-61a48d54da33"></a><a name="section-2.2.3.1"></a><p></p><h4>Age</h4><p class="First">Citalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects &ge; 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies.

Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, <span class="Italics">in vivo </span>data to address this question are limited. </p><p>CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors: Since CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Citalopram 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span>and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). </p><p>CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.</p></div></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34092-7"></a><a name="i4i_clinical_studies_id_d3e3a276-8166-486e-9804-38b9ae62c26a"></a><a name="section-2.3"></a><p></p><h2>Clinical Efficacy Trials</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for depression was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks in duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depression. Study 1, a 6 week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/day, showed that citalopram at doses of 40 and 60 mg/day was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the HAMD depressed mood item (Item 1), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity scale. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 and 20 mg/day doses, and the 60 mg/day dose was not more effective than the 40 mg/day dose. In study 2, a 4 week, placebo-controlled trial in depressed patients, of whom 85% met criteria for melancholia, the initial dose was 20 mg/day, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg/day. Patients treated with citalopram showed significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, HAMD item 1, and the CGI Severity score. In three additional placebo-controlled depression trials, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant, possibly due to high spontaneous response rate, smaller sample size, or, in the case of one study, too low a dose.</p><p>In two long-term studies, depressed patients who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment (fixed doses of 20 or 40 mg/day in one study and flexible doses of 20 to 60 mg/day in the second study) were randomized to continuation of citalopram or to placebo. In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 or 40 mg/day of citalopram.</p><p>Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.</p><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_aa49f081-156c-47aa-8a6a-ea74f8ceb983"></a><a name="section-2.3.1"></a><p></p><h3>Comparison of Clinical Trial Results</h3><p class="First">Highly variable results have been seen in the clinical development of all antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, in those circumstances when the drugs have not been studied in the same controlled clinical trial(s), comparisons among the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of different antidepressant drug products are inherently unreliable. Because conditions of testing (e.g., patient samples, investigators, doses of the treatments administered and compared, outcome measures, etc.) vary among trials, it is virtually impossible to distinguish a difference in drug effect from a difference due to one of the confounding factors just enumerated.</p></div></div></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34067-9"></a><a name="i4i_indications_id_cda6d5af-f5ee-489a-bda5-8c1a93816fae"></a><a name="section-3"></a><p></p><h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1><p class="First">Citalopram tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of depression.</p><p>The efficacy of citalopram in the treatment of depression was established in 4 to 6 week, controlled trials of outpatients whose diagnosis corresponded most closely to the DSM-III and DSM-III-R category of major depressive disorder (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p><p>A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least five of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.

Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. </p><p>Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p><p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications.

It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that citalopram tablets are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.</p></div></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_874ef1da-3355-4c5b-a884-928ab9fa10e0"></a><a name="section-5.3"></a><p></p><h2>Potential for Interaction With Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">In patients receiving serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma. These reactions have also been reported in patients who have recently discontinued SSRI treatment and have been started on an MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Furthermore, limited animal data on the effects of combined use of SSRIs and MAOIs suggest that these drugs may act synergistically to elevate blood pressure and evoke behavioral excitation. Therefore, it is recommended that citalopram should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping citalopram before starting an MAOI.</span></p><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_1bdeca4e-8ebd-4c56-8423-78f0abaa240d"></a><a name="section-5.3.1"></a><p></p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-Like Reactions</h3><p class="First">The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including citalopram treatment, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms. </p><p>The concomitant use of citalopram with MAOIs intended to treat depression is contraindicated. If concomitant treatment of citalopram with a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist (triptan) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.</p><p>The concomitant use of citalopram with serotonin precursors (such as tryptophan) is not recommended. Treatment with citalopram and any concomitant serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. </p></div></div></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42232-9"></a><a name="i4i_precautions_id_11085040-5db1-4d43-87dc-4fa88b6e1269"></a><a name="section-6"></a><p></p><h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34072-9"></a><a name="i4i_precautions_general_id_a3776c8c-a4f6-4a5f-9400-31910f8553d7"></a><a name="section-6.1"></a><p></p><h2>General</h2><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_f2e3df13-cb0f-43f7-a188-32d6da1e144f"></a><a name="section-6.1.1"></a><p></p><h3>Discontinuation of Treatment With Citalopram</h3><p class="First">During marketing of citalopram and other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.</p><p>Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with citalopram. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_ca638bff-2934-47fd-b8db-2c243f464cf8"></a><a name="section-6.1.2"></a><p></p><h3>Abnormal Bleeding</h3><p class="First">SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to the risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. </p><p>Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_6663aee3-8390-434c-88ef-7d91438eb19d"></a><a name="section-6.1.3"></a><p></p><h3>Hyponatremia</h3><p class="First">Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including citalopram. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and was reversible when citalopram was discontinued. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk (see <span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span>). Discontinuation of citalopram should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_bfcc98f4-04e6-4a14-b9c5-43fde33d4bad"></a><a name="section-6.1.4"></a><p></p><h3>Activation of Mania/Hypomania</h3><p class="First">In placebo-controlled trials of citalopram, some of which included patients with bipolar disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in 0.2% of 1063 patients treated with citalopram and in none of the 446 patients treated with placebo. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with other marketed antidepressants.

Due to the risk of QT prolongation, citalopram use should be avoided in patients with certain cardiac conditions, and ECG monitoring is advised if citalopram must be used in such patients. Electrolytes should be monitored in treating patients with diseases or conditions that cause hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). </p><p>In subjects with hepatic impairment, citalopram clearance was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased. The use of citalopram in hepatically impaired patients should be approached with caution and a lower maximum dosage is recommended (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). </p><p>Because citalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination.

Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with citalopram.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_2d92cb2c-0d14-4687-8ce2-d3d55bf488dd"></a><a name="section-6.4.20"></a><p></p><h3>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)</h3><p class="First">There are no clinical studies of the combined use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and citalopram.</p></div></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34083-6"></a><a name="i4i_carcinogenesis_mutagenesis_fertility_id_7cc7096c-1bcd-47ae-a2e3-35ccf00b7af7"></a><a name="section-6.5"></a><p></p><h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_0464ce06-b7ba-4569-bf21-e2ee1af2be40"></a><a name="section-6.5.1"></a><p></p><h3>Carcinogenesis</h3><p class="First">Citalopram was administered in the diet to NMRI/BOM strain mice and COBS WI strain rats for 18 and 24 months, respectively.

This dose was also associated with maternal toxicity (clinical signs, decreased body weight gain). The developmental, no-effect dose of 56 mg/kg/day is approximately 9 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In a rabbit study, no adverse effects on embryo/fetal development were observed at doses of up to 16 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Thus, teratogenic effects were observed at a maternally toxic dose in the rat and were not observed in the rabbit.</p><p>When female rats were treated with citalopram (4.8, 12.8, or 32 mg/kg/day) from late gestation through weaning, increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days after birth and persistent offspring growth retardation were observed at the highest dose, which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The no-effect dose of 12.8 mg/kg/day is approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.

A no-effect dose was not determined in that study.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, citalopram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p></div></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34078-6"></a><a name="i4i_non_teratogenic_id_99a9fe98-c746-4a16-a3be-cea50e695a76"></a><a name="section-6.6.2"></a><p></p><h3>Nonteratogenic Effects</h3><p class="First">Neonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective, case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk.</p><p>When treating a pregnant woman with citalopram during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication.</p></div></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34079-4"></a><a name="i4i_labour_delivery_id_7d6086c0-e9cc-4246-880d-f240e625e5b4"></a><a name="section-6.7"></a><p></p><h2>Labor and Delivery</h2><p class="First">The effect of citalopram on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34080-2"></a><a name="i4i_nursing_mothers_id_91b78a59-6283-4a87-84f7-46f9d3cd4515"></a><a name="section-6.8"></a><p></p><h2>Nursing Mothers</h2><p class="First">As has been found to occur with many other drugs, citalopram is excreted in human breast milk.

There were, in addition, over 19,000 exposures from mostly open-label, European postmarketing studies. The conditions and duration of treatment with citalopram varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term and long-term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations.</p><p>Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing.

Citalopram has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. The premarketing clinical experience with citalopram did not reveal any drug-seeking behavior. However, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict, on the basis of this limited experience, the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate citalopram patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementations of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p></div></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm34088-5"></a><a name="i4i_overdosage_id_663951d7-b850-43ac-9b9f-c580f6b5c145"></a><a name="section-9"></a><p></p><h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_b61dc0a5-71e1-44b0-99b1-7a8ec0c7496b"></a><a name="section-9.1"></a><p></p><h2>Human Experience</h2><p class="First">In clinical trials of citalopram, there were reports of citalopram overdose, including overdoses of up to 2000 mg, with no associated fatalities. During the postmarketing evaluation of citalopram, citalopram overdoses, including overdoses of up to 6000 mg, have been reported.

Gastric evacuation by lavage and use of activated charcoal should be considered. Careful observation and cardiac and vital sign monitoring are recommended, along with general symptomatic and supportive care. Due to the large volume of distribution of citalopram, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. There are no specific antidotes for citalopram.</p><p>In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement.

Systematic evaluation of citalopram in two studies has shown that its antidepressant efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 6 or 8 weeks of initial treatment (32 weeks total). In one study, patients were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of citalopram (20 to 60 mg/day) during maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, while in the other study, patients were assigned randomly to continuation of citalopram 20 or 40 mg/day, or placebo, for maintenance treatment. In the latter study, the rates of relapse to depression were similar for the two dose groups (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, <span class="Bold">Clinical Efficacy Trials</span>). Based on these limited data, it is not known whether the dose of citalopram needed to maintain euthymia is identical to the dose needed to induce remission.

There was an increase in both incidence and severity of retinal pathology in both male and female rats receiving 80 mg/kg/day (13 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 60 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Similar findings were not present in rats receiving 24 mg/kg/day for two years, in mice treated for 18 months at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day, or in dogs treated for one year at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (4, 20, and 10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p><p>Additional studies to investigate the mechanism for this pathology have not been performed, and the potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established.</p></div><div class="Section"><a name="nlm42229-5"></a><a name="i4i_section_id_9267ef26-805f-4552-aff3-eca39888d14a"></a><a name="section-12.2"></a><p></p><h2>Cardiovascular Changes in Dogs</h2><p class="First">In a one-year toxicology study, 5 of 10 beagle dogs receiving oral doses of 8 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of 60 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) died suddenly between weeks 17 and 31 following initiation of treatment. Although appropriate data from that study are not available to directly compare plasma levels of citalopram (CT) and its metabolites, demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), to levels that have been achieved in humans, pharmacokinetic data indicate that the relative dog-to-human exposure was greater for the metabolites than for citalopram. Sudden deaths were not observed in rats at doses up to 120 mg/kg/day, which produced plasma levels of CT, DCT, and DDCT similar to those observed in dogs at doses of 8 mg/kg/day. A subsequent intravenous dosing study demonstrated that in beagle dogs, DDCT caused QT prolongation, a known risk factor for the observed outcome in dogs. This effect occurred in dogs at doses producing peak DDCT plasma levels of 810 to 3250 nM (39 to 155 times the mean steady state DDCT plasma level measured at the maximum recommended human daily dose of 60 mg). In dogs, peak DDCT plasma concentrations are approximately equal to peak CT plasma concentrations, whereas in humans, steady state DDCT plasma concentrations are less than 10% of steady state CT plasma concentrations. Assays of DDCT plasma concentrations in 2020 citalopram-treated individuals demonstrated that DDCT levels rarely exceeded 70 nM; the highest measured level of DDCT in human overdose was 138 nM. While DDCT is ordinarily present in humans at lower levels than in dogs, it is unknown whether there are individuals who may achieve higher DDCT levels. The possibility that DCT, a principal metabolite in humans, may prolong the QT interval in dogs has not been directly examined because DCT is rapidly converted to DDCT in that species.</p><p><span class="Bold">TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA</span></p><p>Sellersville, PA 18960</p><p>Rev.
