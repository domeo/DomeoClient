To minimize the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, permanently discontinue ZIAGEN if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications).</p><p>Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, NEVER restart ZIAGEN or any other abacavir-containing product because more severe symptoms can occur within hours and may include life-threatening hypotension and death.</p><p>When therapy with ZIAGEN has been discontinued for reasons other than symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction, and if reinitiation of ZIAGEN or any other abacavir-containing product is under consideration, carefully evaluate the reason for discontinuation of ZIAGEN to ensure that the patient did not have symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If the patient is of unknown HLA-B*5701 status, screening for the allele is recommended prior to reinitiation of ZIAGEN.</p><p>If hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, DO NOT reintroduce ZIAGEN or any other abacavir-containing product. Even in the absence of the HLA-B*5701 allele, it is important to permanently discontinue abacavir and not rechallenge with abacavir if a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds, due to the potential for a severe or even fatal reaction.</p><p>If symptoms consistent with hypersensitivity are not identified, reintroduction can be undertaken with continued monitoring for symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. Make patients aware that a hypersensitivity reaction can occur with reintroduction of ZIAGEN or any other abacavir-containing product and that reintroduction of ZIAGEN or any other abacavir-containing product needs to be undertaken only if medical care can be readily accessed by the patient or others.</p><p style="border-left:1px solid;"><span class="XmChange"><span class="Italics">Risk Factor:<span class="Italics"> HLA-B*5701 Allele: </span></span>Studies have shown that carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele is associated with a significantly increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir.</span></p><p style="border-left:1px solid;"><span class="XmChange">CNA106030 (PREDICT-1), a randomized, double-blind study, evaluated the clinical utility of prospective HLA-B*5701 screening on the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction in abacavir-naive HIV-1-infected adults (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,650). In this study, use of pre-therapy screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele and exclusion of subjects with this allele reduced the incidence of clinically suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions from 7.8% (66/847) to 3.4% (27/803). Based on this study, it is estimated that 61% of patients with the HLA-B*5701 allele will develop a clinically suspected hypersensitivity reaction during the course of abacavir treatment compared with 4% of patients who do not have the HLA-B*5701 allele.</span></p><p style="border-left:1px solid;"><span class="XmChange">Screening for carriage of the HLA -B*5701 allele is recommended prior to initiating treatment with abacavir.

The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir were independent of dose over the range of 300 to 1,200&nbsp;mg/day.</p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption and Bioavailability: </span>Abacavir was rapidly and extensively absorbed after oral administration. The geometric mean absolute bioavailability of the tablet was 83%. After oral administration of 300&nbsp;mg twice daily in 20&nbsp;patients, the steady-state peak serum abacavir concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 3.0&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.89&nbsp;mcg/mL (mean&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;SD) and AUC<span class="Sub">(0-12&nbsp;hr)</span> was 6.02&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;1.73&nbsp;mcg&bull;hr/mL. After oral administration of a single dose of 600&nbsp;mg of abacavir in 20&nbsp;patients, C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 4.26&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;1.19&nbsp;mcg/mL (mean&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;SD) and AUC<span class="Sub">&infin;</span> was 11.95&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;2.51&nbsp;mcg&bull;hr/mL.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution: </span>The apparent volume of distribution after IV administration of abacavir was 0.86&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.15&nbsp;L/kg, suggesting that abacavir distributes into extravascular space. In 3&nbsp;subjects, the CSF AUC<span class="Sub">(0-6&nbsp;hr)</span> to plasma abacavir AUC<span class="Sub">(0-6&nbsp;hr)</span> ratio ranged from 27% to 33%.</p><p>Binding of abacavir to human plasma proteins is approximately 50%. Binding of abacavir to plasma proteins was independent of concentration. Total blood and plasma drug-related radioactivity concentrations are identical, demonstrating that abacavir readily distributes into erythrocytes.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism: </span>In humans, abacavir is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase (to form the 5&prime;-carboxylic acid) and glucuronyl transferase (to form the 5&prime;-glucuronide). The metabolites do not have antiviral activity. In vitro experiments reveal that abacavir does not inhibit human CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity at clinically relevant concentrations.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elimination: </span>Elimination of abacavir was quantified in a mass balance study following administration of a 600-mg dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-abacavir: 99% of the radioactivity was recovered, 1.2% was excreted in the urine as abacavir, 30% as the 5&prime;-carboxylic acid metabolite, 36% as the 5&prime;-glucuronide metabolite, and 15% as unidentified minor metabolites in the urine. Fecal elimination accounted for 16% of the dose.</p><p>In single-dose studies, the observed elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) was 1.54&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.63&nbsp;hours. After intravenous administration, total clearance was 0.80&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.24 L/hr/kg (mean&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;SD).</p><p><span class="Underline">Effects of Food on Oral Absorption:</span> Bioavailability of abacavir tablets was assessed in the fasting and fed states. There was no significant difference in systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">&infin;</span>) in the fed and fasting states; therefore, ZIAGEN Tablets may be administered with or without food. Systemic exposure to abacavir was comparable after administration of ZIAGEN Oral Solution and ZIAGEN Tablets. Therefore, these products may be used interchangeably.</p><p><span class="Underline">Special Populations:</span><span class="Italics"> Renal Impairment:</span> The pharmacokinetic properties of ZIAGEN have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function. Renal excretion of unchanged abacavir is a minor route of elimination in humans. </p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment: </span>The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6). Results showed that there was a mean increase of 89% in the abacavir AUC, and an increase of 58% in the half-life of abacavir after a single dose of 600&nbsp;mg of abacavir. The AUCs of the metabolites were not modified by mild liver disease; however, the rates of formation and elimination of the metabolites were decreased. A dose of 200&nbsp;mg (provided by 10&nbsp;mL of ZIAGEN Oral Solution) administered twice daily is recommended for patients with mild liver disease.

This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. The addition of methadone had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir.</p></div><div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5"><a name="i4i_section_id_a3a975f3-a80a-40d2-9172-7e276172ddfa"></a><a name="section-11.3"></a><p></p><h2>12.4 Microbiology</h2><p class="First">Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue. Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP), an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5&prime;-triphosphate (dGTP). CBV-TP inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA. The lack of a 3&prime;-OH group in the incorporated nucleotide analogue prevents the formation of the 5&prime; to 3&prime; phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated. CBV-TP is a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerases α, β, and γ.</p><p><span class="Underline">Antiviral Activity:</span> The antiviral activity of abacavir against HIV-1 was evaluated against a T-cell tropic laboratory strain HIV-1<span class="Sub">IIIB</span> in lymphoblastic cell lines, a monocyte/macrophage tropic laboratory strain HIV<span class="Italics">-</span>1<span class="Sub">BaL</span> in primary monocytes/macrophages, and clinical isolates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The concentration of drug necessary to effect viral replication by 50&nbsp;percent (EC<span class="Sub">50</span>) ranged from 3.7 to 5.8&nbsp;μM (1&nbsp;μM&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.28&nbsp;mcg/mL) and 0.07 to 1.0&nbsp;μM against HIV-1<span class="Sub">IIIB</span> and HIV-1<span class="Sub">BaL</span>, respectively, and was 0.26&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.18&nbsp;μM against 8&nbsp;clinical isolates. The EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values of abacavir against different HIV-1 clades (A-G) ranged from 0.0015 to 1.05&nbsp;μM, and against HIV-2 isolates, from 0.024 to 0.49&nbsp;μM. Abacavir had synergistic activity in cell culture in combination with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) zidovudine, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) nevirapine, and the protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir; and additive activity in combination with the NRTIs didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zalcitabine. Ribavirin (50&nbsp;μM) had no effect on the anti&ndash;HIV-1 activity of abacavir in cell culture.</p><p><span class="Underline">Resistance:</span> HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to abacavir have been selected in cell culture and were also obtained from patients treated with abacavir. Genotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from abacavir-treated patients demonstrated that amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I in RT contributed to abacavir resistance. In a study of therapy-naive adults receiving ZIAGEN 600&nbsp;mg once daily (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;384) or 300&nbsp;mg twice daily (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;386), in a background regimen of lamivudine 300&nbsp;mg once daily and efavirenz 600&nbsp;mg once daily (CNA30021), the incidence of virologic failure at 48&nbsp;weeks was similar between the 2 groups (11% in both arms). Genotypic (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;38) and phenotypic analyses (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;35) of virologic failure isolates from this study showed that the RT substitutions that emerged during abacavir once-daily and twice-daily therapy were K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I. The substitution M184V/I was the most commonly observed substitution in virologic failure isolates from patients receiving abacavir once daily (56%, 10/18) and twice daily (40%, 8/20).</p><p>Thirty-nine percent (7/18) of the isolates from patients who experienced virologic failure in the abacavir once-daily arm had a greater than 2.5-fold decrease in abacavir susceptibility with a median-fold decrease of 1.3 (range 0.5 to 11) compared with 29% (5/17) of the failure isolates in the twice-daily arm with a median-fold decrease of 0.92 (range 0.7 to 13).</p><p><span class="Underline">Cross-Resistance:</span> Cross-resistance has been observed among NRTIs. Isolates containing abacavir resistance-associated substitutions, namely, K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V, exhibited cross-resistance to didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir, and zalcitabine in cell culture and in patients. The K65R substitution can confer resistance to abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zalcitabine; the L74V substitution can confer resistance to abacavir, didanosine, and zalcitabine; and the M184V substitution can confer resistance to abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and zalcitabine. An increasing number of thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219E/R/H/Q/N) is associated with a progressive reduction in abacavir susceptibility.</p></div></div><div class="Section" data-sectionCode="43680-8"><a name="i4i_nonclinical_toxicology_id_c4f0e5ea-b410-4245-8716-e383e114ec8a"></a><a name="section-12"></a><p></p><h1>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h1><div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34083-6"><a name="i4i_carcinogenesis_mutagenesis_fertility_id_f1f22ac6-116f-4d02-9e19-e9e3dfbbc01a"></a><a name="section-12.1"></a><p></p><h2>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2><p class="First">Abacavir was administered orally at 3&nbsp;dosage levels to separate groups of mice and rats in 2-year carcinogenicity studies.
