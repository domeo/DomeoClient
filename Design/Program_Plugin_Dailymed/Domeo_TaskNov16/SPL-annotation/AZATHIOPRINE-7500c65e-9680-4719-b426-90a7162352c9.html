The sodium salt of azathioprine is sufficiently soluble to make a 10 mg/mL water solution which is stable for 24 hours at 59&deg; to 77&deg;F (15&deg; to 25&deg;C). Azathioprine is stable in solution at neutral or acid pH but hydrolysis to mercaptopurine occurs in excess sodium hydroxide (0.1N), especially on warming. Conversion to mercaptopurine also occurs in the presence of sulfhydryl compounds such as cysteine, glutathione and hydrogen sulfide.</p></div><div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34090-1"><a name="i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_4fb36a7c-c354-42a2-90ae-4ea78e234605"></a><a name="section-3"></a><p></p><h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1><p class="First">Azathioprine is well absorbed following oral administration. Maximum serum radioactivity occurs at 1 to 2 hours after oral <span class="Sup">35</span>S-azathioprine and decays with a half-life of 5 hours. This is not an estimate of the half-life of azathioprine itself, but is the decay rate for all <span class="Sup">35</span>S-containing metabolites of the drug. Because of extensive metabolism, only a fraction of the radioactivity is present as azathioprine. Usual doses produce blood levels of azathioprine, and of mercaptopurine derived from it, which are low (&lt;1 mcg/mL). Blood levels are of little predictive value for therapy since the magnitude and duration of clinical effects correlate with thiopurine nucleotide levels in tissues rather than with plasma drug levels. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are moderately bound to serum proteins (30%) and are partially dialyzable. (See <span class="Bold"><a href="#i4i_overdosage_id_a716ae4b-522e-40c3-9da0-2707b31be59d">OVERDOSAGE</a></span>).</p><p>Azathioprine is metabolized to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). Both compounds are rapidly eliminated from blood and are oxidized or methylated in erythrocytes and liver; no azathioprine or mercaptopurine is detectable in urine after 8 hours. Activation of 6-mercaptopurine occurs via hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) and a series of multi-enzymatic processes involving kinases to form 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6TGNs) as major metabolites (See Metabolism Scheme in <span class="Bold">Figure 1</span>). The cytotoxicity of azathioprine is due, in part, to the incorporation of 6-TGN into DNA. </p><p>6-MP undergoes two major inactivation routes (<span class="Bold">Figure 1</span>). One is thiol methylation, which is catalyzed by the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), to form the inactive metabolite methyl-6-MP (6-MeMP). TPMT activity is controlled by a genetic polymorphism. <span class="Sup">1,2,3 </span>For Caucasians and African Americans, approximately 10% of the population inherit one non-functional TPMT allele (heterozygous) conferring intermediate TPMT activity, and 0.3% inherit two TPMT non-functional alleles (homozygous) for low or absent TPMT activity. Non-functional alleles are less common in Asians. TPMT activity correlates inversely with 6TGN levels in erythrocytes and presumably other hematopoietic tissues, since these cells have negligible xanthine oxidase (involved in the other inactivation pathway) activities, leaving TPMT methylation as the only inactivation pathway. Patients with intermediate TPMT activity may be at increased risk of myelotoxicity if receiving conventional doses of azathioprine. Patients with low or absent TPMT activity are at an increased risk of developing severe, life-threatening myelotoxicity if receiving conventional doses of azathioprine.<span class="Sup">4-9 </span>TPMT genotyping or phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) can help identify patients who are at an increased risk for developing azathioprine toxicity.<span class="Sup">2, 3, 7, 8, 9 </span>Accurate phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) results are not possible in patients who have received recent blood transfusions.

The drug suppresses hypersensitivities of the cell-mediated type and causes variable alterations in antibody production. Suppression of T-cell effects, including ablation of T-cell suppression, is dependent on the temporal relationship to antigenic stimulus or engraftment. This agent has little effect on established graft rejections or secondary responses.</p><p>Alterations in specific immune responses or immunologic functions in transplant recipients are difficult to relate specifically to immunosuppression by azathioprine. These patients have subnormal responses to vaccines, low numbers of T-cells, and abnormal phagocytosis by peripheral blood cells, but their mitogenic responses, serum immunoglobulins and secondary antibody responses are usually normal.</p></div><div class="Section" data-sectionCode="42229-5"><a name="i4i_section_id_80fa073a-588a-44ca-aa67-e7c4c57defd6"></a><a name="section-3.2"></a><p></p><h2>Immunoinflammatory Response</h2><p class="First">Azathioprine suppresses disease manifestations as well as underlying pathology in animal models of auto-immune disease.

Azathioprine is immunosuppressive, delayed hypersensitivity and cellular cytotoxicity tests being suppressed to a greater degree than are antibody responses. In the rat model of adjuvant arthritis, azathioprine has been shown to inhibit the lymph node hyperplasia which precedes the onset of the signs of the disease. Both the immunosuppressive and therapeutic effects in animal models are dose-related. Azathioprine is considered a slow-acting drug and effects may persist after the drug has been discontinued.</p></div></div><div class="Section" data-sectionCode="34067-9"><a name="i4i_indications_id_f74a4dc4-9dc8-423a-94de-2eb9d73253f0"></a><a name="section-4"></a><p></p><h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1><p class="First">Azathioprine Sodium for Injection, USP  is indicated as an adjunct for the prevention of rejection in renal homotransplantation.

Delayed hematologic suppression may occur. Prompt reduction in dosage or temporary withdrawal of the drug may be necessary if there is a rapid fall in or persistently low leukocyte count, or other evidence of bone marrow depression.
