- Evaluate Scheduler
- Split stages in the initialization pipeline

- MOVE THE Y FROM ANNOTATION TO THE SELECTOR

 - deletion of annotation sets
 - analytics for detecting browsers/OS
 - set panel: when changing the filtering, the selected set info might change. Now when moving from my sets to others, the info of one of my set still displays

 
 - disable references toolbar when no references are found (like PubMed)?
 
 
 - update tab label with set name
 - logging of the reference definition process
 - create dynamically a side panel tab
 - display of the annotation details for a set

 - cleanup LPubMedDocumentCardPanel
 - display of references the icons and the text should never be split in two lines
 - mark already saved items as deleted??
 - when deleting items, the sets summary does not get updated
 - add exploration of the set from the set panel, where a glass panel pops up on top of the side panel showing all the annotation items
 - annotation sets show/hide optimization (too many cycles right now)
 - add a right panel for displaying mashups information

 - annotation edit

 - tune cards for citations (hiding when? - action buttons?)
 - links to citations (make them work) - fix stylesheet (pointer cursor) and cleanup Painter
 - working on pubmed central citations prefix/suffix
 - new methods in preferencesManager
 - annotation types in preferences
 - parameters of text mining (list of stopwords defualt and personal)
 - loggin annotation set commands
 - extract references from omim

 - fix overlapping highlights
 - manage access control of sets
 - display details in the annotation set panel through an editable lens
 
 
 - better architect annotation deletion (Two sources, annotations panel and popup).
 - CitationReferencesPanel and PublicationResultsListPanel should both use WidgetUtils for odd and even rows
 - finish PubmedSearchWidget
 - Links pruning
 - Popup should not overflow on the right of the screen
 - simplify the construction of LLinkCard (too many panels)
 - Are tiles components?
 - Better strategy for detecting Y location in Wrapper.
 - highlight default color in preferences
 - Redesign the persistence manager splitting framework and domeo
 - More robust provenance display in lens (if provenance is null should not crash). see OmimExtractMeta without createdOn and creator
 - Add provenance in each item of the customized tab
 - Date format now spread out in different classes like MAnnotation and MDocumentResource
 - Refactor 'Resource' lenses to deal with provenance in a uniform way!
 - Finish citations extractor for PMC
 - When logging an exception, signal the problem in the status bar
 - When content has been saved, signal the completion in the status bar
 
 Major
 - Consider the option of drawing on a document through a layer.
 - Generating a PDF with the document and the related 
 
 Done
  - complete filtering by set in the annotation side panel
  - sets panel filtering by editor (mine, others...)
  - show/hide reference/citations
  - manual annotation and highlight mode are now in two places (now only in toolbar with facade in Domeo)
  - fix: when editing the item creating a new set something goes wrong and no set is created
  - logging of the change of set
  - in FPostItForm create a function that understands if the content changed
  - in FPostItForm create a validation function and point to it in the Apply clickhandlers
  - Refresh only the annotation panels (added refresh for only the annotation related panels)
  - Verify vertical size of panel in OMIM and PubMed resource (the resize was missing)
  - Refactor using 'identity' as package for the plugins data 
  - When loading a generic page after a known one the tabs are not updating correctly (notify end generic pipeline was missing)
  - logging panel not resizing correctly
